  Abstract                 = {Two experiments investigated the extent to which children's mental arithmetic is constrained by working memory rather than their arithmetical competence. A span procedure was used to measure the limit on English- and German-speaking children's ability to add together pairs of multidigit numbers. The children's ages ranged from 7 years 7 months to 11 years 5 months. Spans for mental addition were higher when the numbers to be added were visible throughout calculation than when they were not, consistent with a working memory constraint. Variation in addition span with children's age and with difficulty of the arithmetical operations approximated to a linear function of the speed of adding integers. A similar speed/span relationship has previously been observed for counting span, an artificial task designed to load working memory by combining separate processing and storage subtasks. We conclude that the natural task of mental addition, which combines processing and storage as intrinsic components, reflects working memory in a similar way. Results were remarkably similar both between cultures and across age groups, consistent with the notion of working memory as a general-purpose resource with dynamics that are indifferent to the detailed nature of operations.},

  Abstract                 = {Emergent (http://grey.colorado.edu/emergent) is a powerful tool for the simulation of biologically plausible, complex neural systems that was released in August 2007. Inheriting decades of research and experience in network algorithms and modeling principles from its predecessors, PDP++ and PDP, Emergent has been redesigned as an efficient workspace for academic research and an engaging, easy-to-navigate environment for students. The system provides a modern and intuitive interface for programming and visualization centered around hierarchical, tree-based navigation and drag-and-drop reorganization. Emergent contains familiar, high-level simulation constructs such as Layers and Projections, a wide variety of algorithms, general-purpose data handling and analysis facilities and an integrated virtual environment for developing closed-loop cognitive agents. For students, the traditional role of a textbook has been enhanced by wikis embedded in every project that serve to explain, document, and help newcomers engage the interface and step through models using familiar hyperlinks. For advanced users, the software is easily extensible in all respects via runtime plugins, has a powerful shell with an integrated debugger, and a scripting language that is fully symmetric with the interface. Emergent strikes a balance between detailed, computationally expensive spiking neuron models and abstract, Bayesian or symbolic systems. This middle level of detail allows for the rapid development and successful execution of complex cognitive models while maintaining biological plausibility.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that has been shown effective in improving the cardinal motor signs of advanced Parkinson's disease, however, declines in cognitive function have been associated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. Despite the fact that most activities of daily living clearly have motor and cognitive components performed simultaneously, postoperative assessments of cognitive and motor function occur, in general, in isolation of one another. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of unilateral and bilateral STN DBS on upper extremity motor function and cognitive performance under single- and dual-task conditions in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. Data were collected from eight advanced Parkinson's disease patients between the ages of 48 and 70 years (mean 56.5) who had bilaterally placed STN stimulators. Stimulation parameters for DBS devices were optimized clinically and were stable for at least 6 months prior to study participation. Data were collected while patients were Off anti-parkinsonian medications under three stimulation conditions: Off stimulation, unilateral DBS and bilateral DBS. In each stimulation condition patients performed a cognitive (n-back task) and motor (force tracking) task under single- and dual-task conditions. During dual-task conditions, patients performed the n-back and force-maintenance task simultaneously. Under relatively simple dual-task conditions there were no differences in cognitive or motor performance under unilateral and bilateral stimulation. As dual-task complexity increased, cognitive and motor performance was significantly worse with bilateral compared with unilateral stimulation. In the most complex dual-task condition (i.e. 2-back + force tracking), bilateral stimulation resulted in a level of motor performance that was similar to the Off stimulation condition. Significant declines in cognitive and motor function under modest dual-task conditions with bilateral but not with unilateral STN DBS suggest that unilateral procedures may be an alternative to bilateral DBS for some patients, in particular, those with asymmetric symptomology. From a clinical perspective, these results underscore the need to assess cognitive and motor function simultaneously during DBS programming as these conditions may better reflect the context in which daily activities are performed.},

  Abstract                 = {Basal ganglia disorders are a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes with a common anatomic locus within the basal ganglia. To account for the variety of clinical manifestations associated with insults to various parts of the basal ganglia we propose a model in which specific types of basal ganglia disorders are associated with changes in the function of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons. This model is based on a synthesis of experimental animal and post-mortem human anatomic and neurochemical data. Hyperkinetic disorders, which are characterized by an excess of abnormal movements, are postulated to result from the selective impairment of striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus. Hypokinetic disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, are hypothesized to result from a complex series of changes in the activity of striatal projection neuron subpopulations resulting in an increase in basal ganglia output. This model suggests that the activity of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons is differentially regulated by striatal afferents and that different striatal projection neuron subpopulations may mediate different aspects of motor control.},

  Abstract                 = {Single cell activity was recorded from the putamen in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performing limb movements made both with and without a preceding preparatory "set" concerning the impending direction of movement. The monkeys were trained to perform an elbow step-tracking task, each trial of which required the subject to make two sequential movements that were virtually identical in terms of their direction, amplitude, velocity and muscle pattern. The first movement was preceded by a foreperiod, the "pre-instruction" period, during which the monkey could not predict the direction (flexion/extension) of the forthcoming movement. The second movement was also preceded by a variable foreperiod, the "post-instruction" period, but during this interval the monkey was aware of the impending direction of movement because it was always required to match that of the first movement. To dissociate the directions of motor set (and limb movement) from the patterns of tonic (and phasic) muscular activation associated with task performance, some trials included the application of torque loads that either opposed or assisted the movements required by the behavioral paradigm. Two principal forms of task-related activity were observed among the 232 putamen neurons (all located within the region of arm representation) whose discharge patterns showed significant relations to one or more features of the behavioral paradigm. "Movement-related" neurons (178/232, 76.7\%) discharged selectively in association with either flexion or extension movements of the elbow. "Set-related" neurons (47/232, 20.3\%) manifested sustained, selective changes in discharge throughout the post-instruction period, while the monkey was required to maintain a preparatory set concerning the impending direction of movement. Extensive limb and axial EMG recordings showed no evidence of task-related activity patterns comparable to those that characterized the set-related neurons, and scleral search coil recordings showed no relationship between set-related neuronal activity and either the direction of gaze or the direction and timing of eye movements during task performance. Only a small percentage (7/232, 3.0\%) of the task-related neurons showed both movement- and set-related activity. In most cases (37/47, 79\%), set-related activity was directionally selective, with the magnitude of discharge reflecting the impending direction of movement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {The central theme of the "segregated circuits" hypothesis is that structural convergence and functional integration occurs within, rather than between, each of the identified circuits. Admittedly, the anatomical evidence upon which this scheme is based remains incomplete. The hypothesis continues to be predicated largely on comparisons of anterograde and retrograde labeling studies carried out in different sets of animals. Only in the case of the "motor" circuit has evidence for the continuity of the loop been demonstrated directly in individual subjects; for the other circuits, such continuity is inferred from comparisons of data on different components of each circuit obtained in separate experiments. Because of the marked compression of pathways leading from cortex through basal ganglia to thalamus, comparisons of projection topography across experimental subjects may be hazardous. Definitive tests of the hypothesis of maintained segregation await additional double- and multiple-label tract-tracing experiments wherein the continuity of one circuit, or the segregation of adjacent circuits, can be examined directly in individual subjects. It is worthy of note, however, that the few studies to date that have employed this methodology have generated results consistent with the segregated circuits hypothesis. Moreover, single cell recordings in behaving animals have shown striking preservation of functional specificity at the level of individual neurons throughout the "motor" and "oculomotor" circuits. It is difficult to imagine how such functional specificity could be maintained in the absence of strict topographic specificity within the sequential projections that comprise these two circuits. This is not to say, however, that we expect the internal structure of functional channels (e.g., the "arm" channel within the "motor" circuit) to have cable-like, point-to-point topography. When the grain of analysis is sufficiently fine, anatomical studies have shown repeatedly that the terminal fields of internuclear projections (e.g., to striatum, pallidum, nigra, thalamus, etc.) often appear patchy and highly divergent, suggesting that neighboring groups of projection cells tend to influence interdigitating clusters of postsynaptic neurons. While more intricate and complex than simple point-to-point topography, however, this type arrangement should also be capable of maintaining functional specificity. As discussed briefly above, it is not yet clear to what extent the inputs to the "motor" circuit from the different precentral motor fields (e.g., MC, SMA, APA) are integrated in their passage through the circuit. It now appears that at the level of the putamen such inputs remain segregated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Neurons in both structures that encode reward-predictive cues may underlie the decision to respond to such cues, but the neural circuits by which the BLA influences reward-seeking behavior have not been established. Here, we test the hypothesis that the BLA drives NAc neuronal responses to reward-predictive cues. First, using a disconnection experiment, we show that the BLA and dopamine projections to the NAc interact to promote the reward-seeking behavioral response. Next, we demonstrate that BLA neuronal responses to cues precede those of NAc neurons and that cue-evoked excitation of NAc neurons depends on BLA input. These results indicate that BLA input is required for dopamine to enhance the cue-evoked firing of NAc neurons and that this enhanced firing promotes reward-seeking behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The finding that number processing activates a cortical network partly overlapping that recruited for hand movements has renewed interest in the relationship between number and finger representations. Further evidence about a possible link between fingers and numbers comes from developmental studies showing that finger movements play a crucial role in learning counting. However, increased activity in hand motor circuits during counting may unveil unspecific processes, such as shifting attention, reciting number names, or matching items with a number name. To address this issue, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure changes in corticospinal (CS) excitability during a counting task performed silently and using either numbers or letters of the alphabet to enumerate items. We found an increased CS excitability of hand muscles during the counting task, irrespective of the use of numbers or letters, whereas it was unchanged in arm and foot muscles. Control tasks allowed us to rule out a possible influence of attention allocation or covert speech on CS excitability increase of hand muscles during counting. The present results support a specific involvement of hand motor circuits in counting because no CS changes were found in arm and foot muscles during the same task. However, the contribution of hand motor areas is not exclusively related to number processing because an increase in CS excitability was also found when letters were used to enumerate items. This finding suggests that hand motor circuits are involved whenever items have to be put in correspondence with the elements of any ordered series.},

  Abstract                 = {Tonically active neurons (TANs) in the primate striatum are responsive to rewarding stimuli and they are thought to be involved in the storage of stimulus-reward associations or habits. However, it is unclear whether these neurons may signal the difference between the prediction of reward and its actual outcome as a possible neuronal correlate of reward prediction errors at the striatal level. To address this question, we studied the activity of TANs from three monkeys trained in a classical conditioning task in which a liquid reward was preceded by a visual stimulus and reward probability was systematically varied between blocks of trials. The monkeys' ability to discriminate the conditions according to probability was assessed by monitoring their mouth movements during the stimulus-reward interval. We found that the typical TAN pause responses to the delivery of reward were markedly enhanced as the probability of reward decreased, whereas responses to the predictive stimulus were somewhat stronger for high reward probability. In addition, TAN responses to the omission of reward consisted of either decreases or increases in activity that became stronger with increasing reward probability. It therefore appears that one group of neurons differentially responded to reward delivery and reward omission with changes in activity into opposite directions, while another group responded in the same direction. These data indicate that only a subset of TANs could detect the extent to which reward occurs differently than predicted, thus contributing to the encoding of positive and negative reward prediction errors that is relevant to reinforcement learning.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppressing an already initiated manual response depends critically on the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), yet it is unclear how this inhibitory function is implemented in the motor system. It has been suggested that the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which is a part of the basal ganglia, may play a role because it is well placed to suppress the "direct" fronto-striatal pathway that is activated by response initiation. In two experiments, we investigated this hypothesis with functional magnetic resonance imaging and a Stop-signal task. Subjects responded to Go signals and attempted to inhibit the initiated response to occasional Stop signals. In experiment 1, Going significantly activated frontal, striatal, pallidal, and motor cortical regions, consistent with the direct pathway, whereas Stopping significantly activated right IFC and STN. In addition, Stopping-related activation was significantly greater for fast inhibitors than slow ones in both IFC and STN, and activity in these regions was correlated across subjects. In experiment 2, high-resolution functional and structural imaging confirmed the location of Stopping activation within the vicinity of the STN. We propose that the role of the STN is to suppress thalamocortical output, thereby blocking Go response execution. These results provide convergent data for a role for the STN in Stop-signal response inhibition. They also suggest that the speed of Go and Stop processes could relate to the relative activation of different neural pathways. Future research is required to establish whether Stop-signal inhibition could be implemented via a direct functional neuroanatomic projection between IFC and STN (a "hyperdirect" pathway).},

The children were also assessed on counting and eye-hand coordination. CP children exhibited a lower subitizing limit than control children. In CP and control children, the subitizing limit increased significantly with age. In CP children, the subitizing limit was positively correlated with counting performance, and both were positively correlated with eye-hand coordination. In addition, the subitizing limit in CP children with no evidence of a right-hemisphere lesion tended to be higher than in children with a right or bilateral lesion, suggesting right-hemisphere involvement in subitizing. These results support the idea that subitizing and counting are not independent processes during development, and argue in favor of a model of subitizing that relies on a global process.},

A computational model of WM, called FROST (short for FROntal-Striatal-Thalamic), is proposed in which the representation of items and spatial positions is encoded in the lateral prefrontal cortex. During delay intervals, activation in these prefrontal cells is sustained via parallel, prefrontal cortical-thalamic loops. Activation reverberates in these loops because prefrontal cortical excitation of the head of the caudate nucleus leads to disinhibition of the thalamus (via the globus pallidus). FROST successfully accounts for a wide variety of WM data, including single-cell recording data and human behavioral data.},

The model assumes 2 neural pathways from sensory association cortex to the premotor area that mediates response selection. A longer and slower path projects to the premotor area via the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. A faster, purely cortical path projects directly to the premotor area. The model assumes that the subcortical path has greater neural plasticity because of a dopamine-mediated learning signal from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the cortical-cortical path learns more slowly via (dopamine independent) Hebbian learning. Because of its greater plasticity, early performance is dominated by the subcortical path, but the development of automaticity is characterized by a transfer of control to the faster cortical-cortical projection. The model, called SPEED (Subcortical Pathways Enable Expertise Development), includes differential equations that describe activation in the relevant brain areas and difference equations that describe the 2- and 3-factor learning. A variety of simulations are described, showing that the model accounts for some classic single-cell recording and behavioral results.},

  Abstract                 = {A typical Go/No-Go decision is suggested to be implemented in the brain via the activation of the direct or indirect pathway in the basal ganglia. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, receiving input from cortex and projecting to the direct and indirect pathways express D1 and D2 type dopamine receptors, respectively. Recently, it has become clear that the two types of MSNs markedly differ in their mutual and recurrent connectivities as well as feedforward inhibition from FSIs. Therefore, to understand striatal function in action selection, it is of key importance to identify the role of the distinct connectivities within and between the two types of MSNs on the balance of their activity. Here, we used both a reduced firing rate model and numerical simulations of a spiking network model of the striatum to analyze the dynamic balance of spiking activities in D1 and D2 MSNs. We show that the asymmetric connectivity of the two types of MSNs renders the striatum into a threshold device, indicating the state of cortical input rates and correlations by the relative activity rates of D1 and D2 MSNs. Next, we describe how this striatal threshold can be effectively modulated by the activity of fast spiking interneurons, by the dopamine level, and by the activity of the GPe via pallidostriatal backprojections. We show that multiple mechanisms exist in the basal ganglia for biasing striatal output in favour of either the `Go' or the `No-Go' pathway. This new understanding of striatal network dynamics provides novel insights into the putative role of the striatum in various behavioral deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease, including increased reaction times, L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia, and deep brain stimulation-induced impulsivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The lateral habenula (LHb) provides an important source of negative reinforcement signals to midbrain dopamine (DA) cells in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA). This profound and consistent inhibitory influence involves a disynaptic connection from glutamate neurons in the LHb to some population of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) cells that, in turn, innervates DA neurons. Previous studies demonstrated that the GABA cells intrinsic to the VTA receive insufficient synaptic input from the LHb to serve as the primary source of this intermediate connection. In this investigation, we sought ultrastructural evidence supporting the hypothesis that a newly identified region of the brainstem, the rostromedial mesopontine tegmental nucleus (RMTg), is a more likely candidate for inhibiting midbrain DA cells in response to LHb activation. Electron microscopic examination of rat brain sections containing dual immunoreactivity for an anterograde tracing agent and a phenotypic marker revealed that: 1) more than 55\% of the synapses formed by LHb axons in the RMTg were onto GABA-labeled dendrites; 2) more than 80\% of the synapses formed by RMTg axons in the VTA contacted dendrites immunoreactive for the DA synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase; and 3) nearly all RMTg axons formed symmetric synapses and contained postembedding immunoreactivity for GABA. These findings indicate that the newly identified RMTg region is an intermediate structure in a disynaptic pathway that connects the LHb to VTA DA neurons. The results have important implications for understanding mental disorders characterized by a dysregulation of reward circuitry involving LHb and DA cell populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Reinforcement (trial-and-error) learning in animals is driven by a multitude of processes. Most animals have evolved several sophisticated systems of 'extrinsic motivations' (EMs) that guide them to acquire behaviours allowing them to maintain their bodies, defend against threat, and reproduce. Animals have also evolved various systems of 'intrinsic motivations' (IMs) that allow them to acquire actions in the absence of extrinsic rewards. These actions are used later to pursue such rewards when they become available. Intrinsic motivations have been studied in Psychology for many decades and their biological substrates are now being elucidated by neuroscientists. In the last two decades, investigators in computational modelling, robotics and machine learning have proposed various mechanisms that capture certain aspects of IMs. However, we still lack models of IMs that attempt to integrate all key aspects of intrinsically motivated learning and behaviour while taking into account the relevant neurobiological constraints. This paper proposes a bio-constrained system-level model that contributes a major step towards this integration. The model focusses on three processes related to IMs and on the neural mechanisms underlying them: (a) the acquisition of action-outcome associations (internal models of the agent-environment interaction) driven by phasic dopamine signals caused by sudden, unexpected changes in the environment; (b) the transient focussing of visual gaze and actions on salient portions of the environment; (c) the subsequent recall of actions to pursue extrinsic rewards based on goal-directed reactivation of the representations of their outcomes. The tests of the model, including a series of selective lesions, show how the focussing processes lead to a faster learning of action-outcome associations, and how these associations can be recruited for accomplishing goal-directed behaviours. The model, together with the background knowledge reviewed in the paper, represents a framework that can be used to guide the design and interpretation of empirical experiments on IMs, and to computationally validate and further develop theories on them.},

The first is learning about the instrumental contingency between the response and reward, whereas the second consists of the acquisition of incentive value by the reward. Evidence for contingency learning comes from studies of reward devaluation and from demonstrations that instrumental performance is sensitive not only the probability of contiguous reward but also to the probability of unpaired rewards. The process of incentive learning is evident in the acquisition of control over performance by primary motivational states. Preliminary lesion studies of the rat suggest that the prelimbic area of prefrontal cortex plays a role in the contingency learning, whereas the incentive learning for food rewards involves the insular cortex.},

We report two autoshaping studies and a study on aversive conditioning in goldfish in which we examine timing at the start of conditioning. We also review data from a number of other conditioning preparations, including fear-potentiated startle, appetitive conditioning in rats, and eyeblink conditioning in rabbits, that report conditioned response (CR) timing early in training. Acquisition speed and the very first expressions of conditioned responding often show sensitivity to the time of US presentation. In instances where temporal control is slowly expressed, it is likely due to performance factors, not to slow learning about time. In fact, the learning about time may be a necessary condition for associative learning.},

Models of the basal ganglia have undergone evolutionary and revolutionary changes over the last 20 years, as new research in the fields of anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of these nuclei has yielded new information. Early models dealt with a single pathway through the nuclei and focused on the nature of the processing performed within it, convergence of information versus parallel processing of information. Later, the Albin-DeLong "box-and-arrow" model characterized the inter-nuclei interaction as multiple pathways while maintaining a simplistic scalar representation of the nuclei themselves. This model made a breakthrough by providing key insights into the behavior of these nuclei in hypo- and hyper-kinetic movement disorders. The next generation of models elaborated the intra-nuclei interactions and focused on the role of the basal ganglia in action selection and sequence generation which form the most current consensus regarding basal ganglia function in both normal and pathological conditions. However, new findings challenge these models and point to a different neural network approach to information processing in the basal ganglia. Here, we take an in-depth look at the reinforcement driven dimensionality reduction (RDDR) model which postulates that the basal ganglia compress cortical information according to a reinforcement signal using optimal extraction methods. The model provides new insights and experimental predictions on the computational capacity of the basal ganglia and their role in health and disease.},

In many of these studies, novelty and surprise are not distinguished from one another: the words are used more-or-less interchangeably. However, while undeniably closely related, novelty and surprise are very different. The purpose of this article is first to highlight the differences between novelty and surprise and to discuss how they are related by presenting an extensive review of mathematical and computational proposals related to them, and then to explore the implications of this for understanding behavioral and neuroscience data.

  Abstract                 = {The amygdala -- an almond-shaped group of nuclei at the heart of the telencephalon -- has been associated with a range of cognitive functions, including emotion, learning, memory, attention and perception. Most current views of amygdala function emphasize its role in negative emotions, such as fear, and in linking negative emotions with other aspects of cognition, such as learning and memory. However, recent evidence supports a role for the amygdala in processing positive emotions as well as negative ones, including learning about the beneficial biological value of stimuli. Indeed, the amygdala's role in stimulus-reward learning might be just as important as its role in processing negative affect and fear conditioning.},

Values were first obtained for all neurons in each layer, and then for GABA neurons as identified with postembedding immunocytochemistry on semithin sections. The numerical density of neurons in the frontal cortex (34,000/mm3) was significantly lower than in the two other neocortical areas (occipital: 52,000; parietal: 48,000/mm3). The GABA population showed a similar difference and consequently represented an equivalent proportion of total (15\%) in the three cortical areas. Across layers, there was an alternate distribution of low and high density of neurons from layers II-III to VI in the three cortical areas, with the highest density in layer IV of the two sensory areas. The laminar changes in density of the GABA neurons were not as pronounced as those of the overall population. Consequently, the layers with the highest overall neuronal densities tended to have a lower proportion of GABA neurons and vice versa. There were more neurons under 1 mm2 of surface in the parietal (90,000) than the occipital or the frontal cortex (71,000), which was also true of the GABA neurons. The greater number of neurons per column in the parietal cortex was mostly imputable to layer IV, the main recipient of thalamic axons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Many neural regions are arranged into two-dimensional topographic maps, such as the retinotopic maps in mammalian visual cortex. Computational simulations have led to valuable insights about how cortical topography develops and functions, but further progress has been hindered by the lack of appropriate tools. It has been particularly difficult to bridge across levels of detail, because simulators are typically geared to a specific level, while interfacing between simulators has been a major technical challenge. In this paper, we show that the Python-based Topographica simulator makes it straightforward to build systems that cross levels of analysis, as well as providing a common framework for evaluating and comparing models implemented in other simulators. These results rely on the general-purpose abstractions around which Topographica is designed, along with the Python interfaces becoming available for many simulators. In particular, we present a detailed, general-purpose example of how to wrap an external spiking PyNN/NEST simulation as a Topographica component using only a dozen lines of Python code, making it possible to use any of the extensive input presentation, analysis, and plotting tools of Topographica. Additional examples show how to interface easily with models in other types of simulators. Researchers simulating topographic maps externally should consider using Topographica's analysis tools (such as preference map, receptive field, or tuning curve measurement) to compare results consistently, and for connecting models at different levels. This seamless interoperability will help neuroscientists and computational scientists to work together to understand how neurons in topographic maps organize and operate.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of dopamine on adaptive behavior in a naturalistic environment is largely unexamined. Experimental work suggests that phasic dopamine is central to reinforcement learning whereas tonic dopamine may modulate performance without altering learning per se; however, this idea has not been developed formally or integrated with computational models of dopamine function. We quantitatively evaluate the role of tonic dopamine in these functions by studying the behavior of hyperdopaminergic DAT knockdown mice in an instrumental task in a semi-naturalistic homecage environment. In this "closed economy" paradigm, subjects earn all of their food by pressing either of two levers, but the relative cost for food on each lever shifts frequently. Compared to wild-type mice, hyperdopaminergic mice allocate more lever presses on high-cost levers, thus working harder to earn a given amount of food and maintain their body weight. However, both groups show a similarly quick reaction to shifts in lever cost, suggesting that the hyperdominergic mice are not slower at detecting changes, as with a learning deficit. We fit the lever choice data using reinforcement learning models to assess the distinction between acquisition and expression the models formalize. In these analyses, hyperdopaminergic mice displayed normal learning from recent reward history but diminished capacity to exploit this learning: a reduced coupling between choice and reward history. These data suggest that dopamine modulates the degree to which prior learning biases action selection and consequently alters the expression of learned, motivated behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuroscience currently lacks a comprehensive theory of how cognitive processes can be implemented in a biological substrate. The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered significant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the NEF. Nengo is a software tool that can be used to build and simulate large-scale models based on the NEF; currently, it is the primary resource for both teaching how the NEF is used, and for doing research that generates specific NEF models to explain experimental data. Nengo 1.4, which was implemented in Java, was used to create Spaun, the world's largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Simulating Spaun highlighted limitations in Nengo 1.4's ability to support model construction with simple syntax, to simulate large models quickly, and to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis. This paper describes Nengo 2.0, which is implemented in Python and overcomes these limitations. It uses simple and extendable syntax, simulates a benchmark model on the scale of Spaun 50 times faster than Nengo 1.4, and has a flexible mechanism for collecting simulation results.},

However, both pleasant and aversive stimuli can elicit arousal and attention, and their salience or intensity increases when they occur by surprise. Thus, adaptive behavior may require that neural circuits compute both stimulus valence--or value--and intensity. To explore how these computations may be implemented, we examined neural responses in the primate amygdala to unexpected reinforcement during learning. Many amygdala neurons responded differently to reinforcement depending upon whether or not it was expected. In some neurons, this modulation occurred only for rewards or aversive stimuli, but not both. In other neurons, expectation similarly modulated responses to both rewards and punishments. These different neuronal populations may subserve two sorts of processes mediated by the amygdala: those activated by surprising reinforcements of both valences-such as enhanced arousal and attention-and those that are valence-specific, such as fear or reward-seeking behavior.},

A single, Pavlovian-conditioned visual stimulus predicted fruit juice to be delivered with one of three equiprobable volumes (P = 1/3). A population of amygdala neurons showed increased activity after reward delivery, and almost one half of these responses covaried with reward magnitude in a monotonically increasing or decreasing fashion. A subset of the reward responding neurons were tested with two different probability distributions of reward magnitude; the reward responses in almost one half of them adapted to the predicted distribution and thus showed reference-dependent coding. These data suggest parametric reward value coding in the amygdala as a characteristic component of its function in reinforcement learning and economic decision making.},

  Abstract                 = {Debate continues over the precise causal contribution made by mesolimbic dopamine systems to reward. There are three competing explanatory categories: 'liking', learning, and 'wanting'. Does dopamine mostly mediate the hedonic impact of reward ('liking')? Does it instead mediate learned predictions of future reward, prediction error teaching signals and stamp in associative links (learning)? Or does dopamine motivate the pursuit of rewards by attributing incentive salience to reward-related stimuli ('wanting')? Each hypothesis is evaluated here, and it is suggested that the incentive salience or 'wanting' hypothesis of dopamine function may be consistent with more evidence than either learning or 'liking'. In brief, recent evidence indicates that dopamine is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate changes in hedonic 'liking' for sensory pleasures. Other recent evidence indicates that dopamine is not needed for new learning, and not sufficient to directly mediate learning by causing teaching or prediction signals. By contrast, growing evidence indicates that dopamine does contribute causally to incentive salience. Dopamine appears necessary for normal 'wanting', and dopamine activation can be sufficient to enhance cue-triggered incentive salience. Drugs of abuse that promote dopamine signals short circuit and sensitize dynamic mesolimbic mechanisms that evolved to attribute incentive salience to rewards. Such drugs interact with incentive salience integrations of Pavlovian associative information with physiological state signals. That interaction sets the stage to cause compulsive 'wanting' in addiction, but also provides opportunities for experiments to disentangle 'wanting', 'liking', and learning hypotheses. Results from studies that exploited those opportunities are described here.In short, dopamine's contribution appears to be chiefly to cause 'wanting' for hedonic rewards, more than 'liking' or learning for those rewards.},

  Abstract                 = {Affective neuroscience aims to understand how affect (pleasure or displeasure) is created by brains. Progress is aided by recognizing that affect has both objective and subjective features. Those dual aspects reflect that affective reactions are generated by neural mechanisms, selected in evolution based on their real (objective) consequences for genetic fitness. We review evidence for neural representation of pleasure in the brain (gained largely from neuroimaging studies), and evidence for the causal generation of pleasure (gained largely from brain manipulation studies). We suggest that representation and causation may actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions. Representation reaches an apex in limbic regions of prefrontal cortex, especially orbitofrontal cortex, influencing decisions and affective regulation. Causation of core pleasure or 'liking' reactions is much more subcortically weighted, and sometimes surprisingly localized. Pleasure 'liking' is especially generated by restricted hedonic hotspot circuits in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum. Another example of localized valence generation, beyond hedonic hotspots, is an affective keyboard mechanism in NAc for releasing intense motivations such as either positively valenced desire and/or negatively valenced dread.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further.},

  Abstract                 = {Much evidence indicates that recognition memory involves two separable processes, recollection and familiarity discrimination, with familiarity discrimination being dependent on the perirhinal cortex of the temporal lobe. Here, we describe a new neural network model designed to mimic the response patterns of perirhinal neurons that signal information concerning the novelty or familiarity of stimuli. The model achieves very fast and accurate familiarity discrimination while employing biologically plausible parameters and Hebbian learning rules. The fact that the activity patterns of the model's simulated neurons are closely similar to those of neurons recorded from the primate perirhinal cortex indicates that this brain region could discriminate familiarity using principles akin to those of the model. If so, the capacity of the model establishes that the perirhinal cortex alone may discriminate the familiarity of many more stimuli than current neural network models indicate could be recalled (recollected) by all the remaining areas of the cerebral cortex. This efficiency and speed of detecting novelty provides an evolutionary advantage, thereby providing a reason for the existence of a familiarity discrimination network in addition to networks used for recollection.},

  Abstract                 = {The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei involved in a variety of processes including motor, cognitive and mnemonic functions. One of their major roles is to integrate sensorimotor, associative and limbic information in the production of context-dependent behaviours. These roles are exemplified by the clinical manifestations of neurological disorders of the basal ganglia. Recent advances in many fields, including pharmacology, anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology have provided converging data that have led to unifying hypotheses concerning the functional organisation of the basal ganglia in health and disease. The major input to the basal ganglia is derived from the cerebral cortex. Virtually the whole of the cortical mantle projects in a topographic manner onto the striatum, this cortical information is 'processed' within the striatum and passed via the so-called direct and indirect pathways to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The basal ganglia influence behaviour by the projections of these output nuclei to the thalamus and thence back to the cortex, or to subcortical 'premotor' regions. Recent studies have demonstrated that the organisation of these pathways is more complex than previously suggested. Thus the cortical input to the basal ganglia, in addition to innervating the spiny projection neurons, also innervates GABA interneurons, which in turn provide a feed-forward inhibition of the spiny output neurons. Individual neurons of the globus pallidus innervate basal ganglia output nuclei as well as the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta. About one quarter of them also innervate the striatum and are in a position to control the output of the striatum powerfully as they preferentially contact GABA interneurons. Neurons of the pallidal complex also provide an anatomical substrate, within the basal ganglia, for the synaptic integration of functionally diverse information derived from the cortex. It is concluded that the essential concept of the direct and indirect pathways of information flow through the basal ganglia remains intact but that the role of the indirect pathway is more complex than previously suggested and that neurons of the globus pallidus are in a position to control the activity of virtually the whole of the basal ganglia.},

  Abstract                 = {A view-invariant representation of objects in the brain would have many computational advantages. Here we describe a population of single neurons in the temporal visual cortex (IT) that have view-invariant representations of familiar objects. Ten real plastic objects were placed in the monkeys' home cages for a period of time before neurophysiological experiments in which neuronal responses were measured to four views of each object. The macaques performed a visual fixation task, and had never been trained in object discrimination. The majority of the visual neurons recorded were responsive to some views of some objects and/or to the control stimuli, as would be expected from previous studies. However, a small subset of these neurons were responsive to all views of one or more of the objects, providing evidence that these neurons were coding for objects, rather than simply for individual views or visual features within the image. This result was confirmed by information theoretic analyses, which showed that the neurons provided information about which object was being seen, independently of the view. The coding scheme was shown to be sparse distributed, with relatively independent information being provided by the different neurons. Hypotheses about how these view-invariant cells are formed are described.},

Discrete multisynaptic loops connect both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia with multiple areas of the cerebral cortex. Interactions between these loops have traditionally been thought to occur mainly at the level of the cerebral cortex. Here, we review a series of recent anatomical studies in nonhuman primates that challenge this perspective. We show that the anatomical substrate exists for substantial interactions between the cerebellum and the basal ganglia. Furthermore, we discuss how these pathways may provide a useful framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to the manifestation of two prototypical basal ganglia disorders, Parkinson's disease and dystonia.},

  Abstract                 = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure-the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},

In view of its connectivity, tVTA is well placed to convey salient positive and negative signals to dopamine cells and participate in adaptative behavioral responses. This structure could act as a hub converging and integrating widespread multimodal signals toward dopamine systems. The tVTA participates in prediction error, motor control, and responses to aversive stimuli and drugs of abuse. In light of the crucial role of the tVTA in the opiate control of dopamine activity, a neuroanatomical update of the disinhibition model of morphine action is proposed.},

In a previous work, we proposed a method that allows exact simulation of an integrate-and-fire model with exponential conductances, with the constraint of a single synaptic time constant. In this note, we propose a method, based on polynomial root finding, that applies to integrate-and-fire models with exponential currents, with possibly many different synaptic time constants.

We start by reviewing the different types of simulation strategies and algorithms that are currently implemented. We next review the precision of those simulation strategies, in particular in cases where plasticity depends on the exact timing of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation environments presently available (restricted to those freely available, open source and documented). For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem related to spiking neural networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Midbrain dopamine neurons play central roles in reward processing. It is widely assumed that all dopamine neurons encode the same information. Some evidence, however, suggests functional differences between subgroups of dopamine neurons, particularly with respect to processing nonrewarding, aversive stimuli. To directly test this possibility, we recorded from and juxtacellularly labeled individual ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in anesthetized rats so that we could link precise anatomical position and neurochemical identity with coding for noxious stimuli. Here, we show that dopamine neurons in the dorsal VTA are inhibited by noxious footshocks, consistent with their role in reward processing. In contrast, we find that dopamine neurons in the ventral VTA are phasically excited by footshocks. This observation can explain a number of previously confusing findings that suggested a role for dopamine in processing both rewarding and aversive events. Taken together, our results indicate that there are 2 functionally and anatomically distinct VTA dopamine systems.},

We hypothesized that information-seeking is assigned value by the same circuits that support reward-seeking, such that neural signals encoding reward prediction errors (RPEs) include analogous information prediction errors (IPEs). To test this, we recorded from neurons in the lateral habenula, a nucleus that encodes RPEs, while monkeys chose between cues that provided different chances to view information about upcoming rewards. We found that a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons transmitted signals resembling IPEs, responding when reward information was unexpectedly cued, delivered or denied. These signals evaluated information sources reliably, even when the monkey's decisions did not. These neurons could provide a common instructive signal for reward-seeking and information-seeking behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The reward value of a stimulus can be learned through two distinct mechanisms: reinforcement learning through repeated stimulus-reward pairings and abstract inference based on knowledge of the task at hand. The reinforcement mechanism is often identified with midbrain dopamine neurons. Here we show that a neural pathway controlling the dopamine system does not rely exclusively on either stimulus-reward pairings or abstract inference but instead uses a combination of the two. We trained monkeys to perform a reward-biased saccade task in which the reward values of two saccade targets were related in a systematic manner. Animals used each trial's reward outcome to learn the values of both targets: the target that had been presented and whose reward outcome had been experienced (experienced value) and the target that had not been presented but whose value could be inferred from the reward statistics of the task (inferred value). We then recorded from three populations of reward-coding neurons: substantia nigra dopamine neurons; a major input to dopamine neurons, the lateral habenula; and neurons that project to the lateral habenula, located in the globus pallidus. All three populations encoded both experienced values and inferred values. In some animals, neurons encoded experienced values more strongly than inferred values, and the animals showed behavioral evidence of learning faster from experience than from inference. Our data indicate that the pallidus-habenula-dopamine pathway signals reward values estimated through both experience and inference.},

We found that lateral habenula and dopamine neurons accessed two distinct reward memories: a short-timescale memory expressed at the start of the task and a near-optimal long-timescale memory expressed when a future reward outcome was revealed. The short- and long-timescale memories were expressed in different forms of reward-oriented eye movements. Our data show that the habenula-dopamine pathway contains multiple timescales of memory and provide evidence for their role in motivated behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {After classically conditioned learning, dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) respond immediately to unexpected conditioned stimuli (CS) but omit formerly seen responses to expected unconditioned stimuli, notably rewards. These cells play an important role in reinforcement learning. A neural model explains the key neurophysiological properties of these cells before, during, and after conditioning, as well as related anatomical and neurophysiological data about the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN), lateral hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and striosomes. The model proposes how two parallel learning pathways from limbic cortex to the SNc, one devoted to excitatory conditioning (through the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and PPTN) and the other to adaptively timed inhibitory conditioning (through the striosomes), control SNc responses. The excitatory pathway generates CS-induced excitatory SNc dopamine bursts. The inhibitory pathway prevents dopamine bursts in response to predictable reward-related signals. When expected rewards are not received, striosomal inhibition of SNc that is unopposed by excitation results in a phasic drop in dopamine cell activity. The adaptively timed inhibitory learning uses an intracellular spectrum of timed responses that is proposed to be similar to adaptively timed cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These mechanisms are proposed to include metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) spikes that occur with different delays in striosomal cells. A dopaminergic burst in concert with a Ca(2+) spike is proposed to potentiate inhibitory learning. The model provides a biologically predictive alternative to temporal difference conditioning models and explains substantially more data than alternative models.},

  Abstract                 = {How does the brain learn to balance between reactive and planned behaviors? The basal ganglia (BG) and frontal cortex together allow animals to learn planned behaviors that acquire rewards when prepotent reactive behaviors are insufficient. This paper proposes a new model, called TELOS, to explain how laminar circuitry of the frontal cortex, exemplified by the frontal eye fields, interacts with the BG, thalamus, superior colliculus, and inferotemporal and parietal cortices to learn and perform reactive and planned eye movements. The model is formulated as fourteen computational hypotheses. These specify how strategy priming and action planning (in cortical layers III, Va and VI) are dissociated from movement execution (in layer Vb), how the BG help to choose among and gate competing plans, and how a visual stimulus may serve either as a movement target or as a discriminative cue to move elsewhere. The direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathways through the BG are shown to enable complex gating functions, including deferred execution of selected plans, and switching among alternative sensory-motor mappings. Notably, the model can learn and gate the use of a What-to-Where transformation that enables spatially invariant object representations to selectively excite spatially coded movement plans. Model simulations show how dopaminergic reward and non-reward signals guide monkeys to learn and perform saccadic eye movements in the fixation, single saccade, overlap, gap, and delay (memory-guided) saccade tasks. Model cell activation dynamics quantitatively simulate seventeen established types of dynamics exhibited by corresponding real cells during performance of these tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognition memory relies on two processes: (i) identification and (ii) judgement concerning prior occurrence. A system centred on perirhinal cortex appears to be responsible for judgement of prior occurrence based on discrimination of the familiarity of stimuli or their recency of occurrence; in contrast, a hippocampal system probably supplies information concerning the episodic, contextual aspects of recognition memory. This review chiefly concerns the perirhinal system and, in particular, neurones that signal the prior occurrence of stimuli by a decrease in response. Details concerning such decremental responses are given and it is argued that such responses in perirhinal cortex are adequate for and central to discrimination of stimulus familiarity and recency in a wide range of situations. Information is given of similar types of neuronal responses in anatomically related brain regions and what may be deduced about the operation of the recognition memory system. The possibility is discussed that the neuronal responses that signal information concerning the recent occurrence of stimuli may contribute to repetition priming as well as recognition memory. Other described changes in the activity of individual neurones such as response enhancements, or sustained (delay) activity may allow solution of specialised forms of recognition memory tasks where relatively short-term working memory is adequate. Implications of the multi-faceted nature of recognition memory for the interpretation of results are emphasised. Unsolved problems and avenues for future experimentation, including determining the nature of possible underlying synaptic plastic changes, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evidence suggests that the maintenance of an item in working memory is achieved through persistent activity in selective neural assemblies of the cortex. To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, it is essential to investigate how persistent activity is affected by external inputs or neuromodulation. We have addressed these questions using a recurrent network model of object working memory. Recurrence is dominated by inhibition, although persistent activity is generated through recurrent excitation in small subsets of excitatory neurons.Our main findings are as follows. (1) Because of the strong feedback inhibition, persistent activity shows an inverted U shape as a function of increased external drive to the network. (2) A transient external excitation can switch off a network from a selective persistent state to its spontaneous state. (3) The maintenance of the sample stimulus in working memory is not affected by intervening stimuli (distractors) during the delay period, provided the stimulation intensity is not large. On the other hand, if stimulation intensity is large enough, distractors disrupt sample-related persistent activity, and the network is able to maintain a memory only of the last shown stimulus. (4) A concerted modulation of GABA(A) and NMDA conductances leads to a decrease of spontaneous activity but an increase of persistent activity; the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is shown to increase the resistance of the network to distractors. (5) Two mechanisms are identified that produce an inverted U shaped dependence of persistent activity on modulation. The present study therefore points to several mechanisms that enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in working memory states. These mechanisms could be implemented in the prefrontal cortex by dopaminergic projections from the midbrain.},

  Abstract                 = {One traditional and long-held view of medial temporal lobe (MTL) function is that it contains a system of structures that are exclusively involved in memory, and that the extent of memory loss following MTL damage is simply related to the amount of MTL damage sustained. Indeed, human patients with extensive MTL damage are typically profoundly amnesic whereas patients with less extensive brain lesions centred upon the hippocampus typically exhibit only moderately severe anterograde amnesia. Accordingly, the latter observations have elevated the hippocampus to a particularly prominent position within the purported MTL memory system. This article reviews recent lesion studies in macaque monkeys in which the behavioural effects of more highly circumscribed lesions (than those observed to occur in human patients with MTL lesions) to different subregions of the MTL have been examined. These studies have reported new findings that contradict this concept of a MTL memory system. First, the MTL is not exclusively involved in mnemonic processes; some MTL structures, most notably the perirhinal cortex, also contribute to perception. Second, there are some forms of memory, including recognition memory, that are not always affected by selective hippocampal lesions. Third, the data support the idea that regional functional specializations exist within the MTL. For example, the macaque perirhinal cortex appears to be specialized for processing object identity whereas the hippocampus may be specialized for processing spatial and temporal relationships.},

However, several recent reports have directly challenged this dogma by arguing that MTL structures also contribute to perception. Controversy remains as many of the behavioural tasks used have confounded memory with perception. We review the evidence here and highlight new studies in humans and macaques that indicate a perceptual role for MTL in the absence of such confounds. We argue that the challenge to MTL memory system theory is substantiated and that the implications are considerable, namely that most psychologists and neuroscientists have held a fundamentally flawed view of how memory is implemented in the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Impairments in both recognition memory and concurrent discrimination learning have been shown to follow perirhinal cortex ablation in the monkey. The pattern of these impairments is consistent with the hypothesis that the perirhinal cortex has a role in the visual identification of objects. In this study we compared the performance of a group of three cynomolgus monkeys with bilateral perirhinal cortex ablation with that of a group of three normal controls in two tasks designed to test this hypothesis more directly. In experiment 1 the subjects relearned a set of 40 familiar concurrent discrimination problems; the stimuli in each trial were digitized images of real objects presented in one of three different views. After attaining criterion they were tested on the same problems using similar, but previously unseen, views of the objects. In experiment 2 the subjects were tested on their ability to perform 10 of these familiar discriminations with each problem presented in the unfamiliar context of a digitized image of a unique complex scene. The subjects with ablations were significantly impaired on both tasks. These results demonstrate that the role of the perirhinal cortex is not restricted to memory, and they support the hypothesis that the perirhinal cortex is involved in visual object identification. We suggest that the perirhinal cortex is crucially involved in processing coherent concepts of individual objects. A deficit of this nature could underlie the pattern of impairments that follow perirhinal cortex damage in both visual object recognition memory and visual associative memory.},

Three then received bilateral perirhinal cortex ablation, and 5 remained controls. The ablated monkeys were severely impaired in reacquiring the preoperatively acquired set, whereas postoperative learning of 20 new discriminations was not significantly affected. The task was then made more difficult. First, the number of foils from which the stimulus had to be selected was increased to 2, 4, 7, and then 14. Second, larger sets of 40, 80, and 160 problems were presented. Both manipulations revealed some significant but relatively mild impairments in the monkeys with ablations. It is suggested that perirhinal cortex ablation impairs the monkey's capacity to identify individual objects, which leads to deficits in both visual-object recognition memory and discrimination learning.},

Lesions of the perirhinal cortex and lesions of area TE produced different patterns of impairment. The PR group learned the DNMS task as quickly as normal monkeys (N) when the delay between sample and choice was very short (0.5 sec). However, performance of the PR group, unlike that of the N group, fell to chance levels when the delay between sample and choice was lengthened to 10 min. In contrast to the PR group, the TE group was markedly impaired on the DNMS task even at the 0.5-sec delay, and three of four monkeys with TE lesions failed to acquire the task. The results provide support for the idea that perirhinal cortex is important not for perceptual processing, but for the formation and maintenance of long-term memory. Area TE is important for the perceptual processing of visual stimuli.},

Left parietal cortex was activated by either of two manipulations that increased the need to maintain a representation of possible responses. In contrast, lateral prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices were specifically engaged by the need to select among competing response alternatives. These findings support the idea that parietal cortex is involved in activating possible responses on the basis of learned stimulus-response associations, and that prefrontal cortex is recruited when there is a need to select between competing responses.},

These components of the putative 'MTL memory system' are thought to operate together in the service of declarative memory--memory for facts and events--having little or no role in other functions such as perception. Object perception, however, is thought to be independent of the MTL, and instead is usually considered to be the domain of the ventral visual stream (VVS) or 'what' pathway. This 'textbook' view fits squarely into the prevailing paradigm of anatomical modularisation of psychological function in the brain. Recent studies, however, question this view, indicating that first, the MTL is functionally heterogeneous, and second, structures in the MTL might have a role in perception. Furthermore, the specific contributions of the individual structures within the MTL are being elucidated. These new findings indicate that it might no longer be useful to assume a strict functional dissociation between the MTL and the VVS, and that psychological functions might not be modularised in the way usually assumed. We propose an alternative approach to understanding the functions of these brain regions in terms of what computations they perform, and what representations they contain.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a simple connectionist model based on the idea that perirhinal cortex has properties similar to other regions in the ventral visual stream, or 'what' pathway. The model is based on the assumption that representations in the ventral visual stream are organized hierarchically, such that representations of simple features of objects are stored in caudal regions of the ventral visual stream, and representations of the conjunctions of these features are stored in more rostral regions. We propose that a function of these feature conjunction representations is to help to resolve 'feature ambiguity', a property of visual discrimination problems that can emerge when features of an object predict a given outcome (e.g. reward) when part of one object, but predict a different outcome when part of another object. Several recently reported effects of lesions of perirhinal cortex in monkeys have provided key insights into the functions of this region. In the present study these effects were simulated by comparing the performance of connectionist networks before and after removal of a layer of units corresponding to perirhinal cortex. The results of these simulations suggest that effects of lesions in perirhinal cortex on visual discrimination may be due not to the impairment of a specific type of learning or memory, such as declarative or procedural, but to compromising the representations of visual stimuli. Furthermore, we propose that attempting to classify perirhinal cortex function as either 'perceptual' or 'mnemonic' may be misguided, as it seems unlikely that these broad constructs will map neatly onto anatomically defined regions of the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {The perirhinal cortex was once thought to be "silent cortex", virtually ignored by researchers interested in the neurobiology of learning and memory. Following studies of brain damage associated with cases of amnesia, perirhinal cortex is now widely regarded as part of a "medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system". This system is thought to be more or less functionally homogeneous, having a special role in declarative memory, and making little or no contribution to other functions such as perception. In the present article, we summarize an alternative view. First, we propose that components of the putative MTL system such as the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex have distinct and dissociable functions. Second, we provide evidence that the perirhinal cortex has a role in visual discrimination. In addition, we propose a specific role for perirhinal cortex in visual discrimination: the contribution of complex conjunctive representations to the solution of visual discrimination problems with a high degree of "feature ambiguity". These proposals constitute a new view of perirhinal cortex function, one that does not assume strict modularity of function in the occipito-temporal visual stream, but replaces this idea with the notion of a hierarchical representational continuum.},

  Abstract                 = {The present experiment tested predictions of a 'perceptual-mnemonic/feature conjunction' (PMFC) model of perirhinal cortex function. The model predicts that lesions of perirhinal cortex should disrupt complex visual discriminations with a high degree of 'feature ambiguity', a property of visual discrimination problems that can emerge when features of an object are rewarded when they are part of one object, but not when part of another. As feature ambiguity is thought to be the critical factor, such effects should be independent of the number of objects to be discriminated. This was tested directly, by assessing performance of control monkeys and monkeys with aspiration lesions of perirhinal cortex on a series of concurrent discriminations in which the number of object pairs was held constant, but the degree of feature ambiguity was varied systematically. Monkeys were tested in three conditions: Maximum Feature Ambiguity, in which all features were explicitly ambiguous (AB+, CD+, BC-, AD-; the biconditional problem); Minimum Feature Ambiguity, in which no features were explicitly ambiguous (AB+, CD+, EF-, GH-); and Intermediate Feature Ambiguity, in which half the features were explicitly ambiguous (AB+, CD+, CE-, AF-). The pattern of results closely matched that predicted by simulations using a connectionist network: monkeys with perirhinal cortex lesions were unimpaired in the Minimum Feature Ambiguity condition, mildly impaired in the Intermediate Feature Ambiguity condition and severely impaired in the Maximum Feature Ambiguity condition. These results confirm the predictions of the PMFC model, and force a reconsideration of prevailing views regarding perirhinal cortex function.},

  Abstract                 = {Plasticity in the brain reaches far beyond a mere changing of synaptic strengths. Recent time-lapse imaging in the living brain reveals ongoing structural plasticity by forming or breaking of synapses, motile spines, and re-routing of axonal branches in the developing and adult brain. Some forms of structural plasticity do not follow Hebbian- or anti-Hebbian paradigms of plasticity but rather appear to contribute to the homeostasis of network activity. Four decades of lesion studies have brought up a wealth of data on the mutual interdependence of neuronal activity, neurotransmitter release and neuronal morphogenesis and network formation. Here, we review these former studies on structural plasticity in the context of recent experimental studies. We compare spontaneous and experience-dependent structural plasticity with lesion-induced (reactive) structural plasticity that occurs during development and in the adult brain. Understanding the principles of neural network reorganization on a structural level is relevant for a deeper understanding of long-term memory formation as well as for the treatment of neurological diseases such as stroke.},

  Abstract                 = {A given stimulus can induce a pleasant or unpleasant sensation depending on the subject's internal state. The word alliesthesia is proposed to describe this phenomenon. It is, in itself, an adequate motivation for behavior such as food intake or thermoregulation. Therefore, negative regulatory feedback systems, based upon oropharingeal or cutaneous thermal signals are peripheral only in appearance, since the motivational component of the sensation is of internal origin. The internal signals seem to be complex and related to the set points of some regulated variables of the "milieu interieur," like set internal temperature in the case of thermal sensation (15). Alliesthesia can therefore explain the adaptation of these behaviors to their goals. Only three sensations have been studied- thermal, gustatory, and olfactory, but it is probable that alliesthesia also exists in such simple ways as in bringing a signal, usually ignored, to the subject's attention. For example, gastric contractions, not normally perceived, are felt in the state of hunger (16). Since alliesthesia relies on an internal input, it is possible that alliesthesia exists only with sensations related to some constants of the "milieu interieur" and therefore would not exist in visual or auditory sensations. As a matter of fact, luminous or auditory stimuli can be pleasing or displeasing in themselves, but there seems to be little variation of pleasure in these sensations, that is, no alliesthesia. There may be some esthetic value linked to these stimuli but it is a striking coincidence that they are in themselves rather neutral and that it is difficult to imagine a constant of the "milieu interieur" which could be possibly modified by a visual or an auditive stimulus-such as light of a certain wavelength or sound of a given frequency. In the light of this theory, it is possible to reconsider the nature of the whole conscious experience. The existence of alliesthesia implies the presence of internal signals modifying the concious sensations aroused from peripheral receptors. It is therefore necessary to question the existence of sensations aroused by direct stimulation of central receptors, such as hypothalamic temperature detectors, osmoreceptors, and others. Does their excitation arouse sensations of their own, or does the sensation have to pass through peripheral senses? Only human experimentation could answer this question. In the same way, it is possible that selfstimulation of the brain is pleasant, not by giving a sensation in itself, but because the electrical stimulus (17), renders peripheral stimuli pleasant.},

  Abstract                 = {Intracellular recordings were obtained from rat neostriatal slices. Bath-applied dopamine (1-10 microM) produced a reversible inhibition of the action potentials evoked by direct stimulation and a decrease in the amplitude of the intrastriatally evoked depolarizing postsynaptic potentials. No change in membrane potential was detected during the application of 1-10 microM dopamine. Dopamine application also produced a decrease in anomalous rectification in the depolarizing direction. This subthreshold inward rectification was abolished by tetrodotoxin, but not by calcium-free and cadmium (0.1-1 mM)-containing solutions. The dopamine-induced decrease in excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude was evident at resting membrane potential or at more positive levels, but was absent at hyperpolarized values of the membrane potential. Addition of bicuculline (50-500 microM) to the medium did not affect the inhibitory action of dopamine. The inhibitory action of dopamine also persisted in calcium-free and cadmium-containing solutions. The adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate analogue, 8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (0.1-1 mM), mimicked the effects produced by D1 receptor activation. Bath application of 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine (SKF 38393) (1-10 microM), a selective D1 dopaminergic agonist, mimicked the effects of micromolar concentrations of dopamine. The D2 dopaminergic agonists, 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-n-propyl-2H-pyrazolo-3,4-g-quinoline (LY 171555) and bromocriptine (both at 10 nM-10 microM), had no effects on neostriatal cells. The inhibition induced by micromolar doses of dopamine or SKF 38393 was antagonized by bath applications of R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin++ +-7-ol (SCH 23390; 0.1-10 microM), a D1-selective antagonist, but not by sulpiride (10 nM-10 microM), a D2 antagonist. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on rat striatal neurons is postsynaptically mediated by the activation of D1 dopaminergic receptors via the reduction of a voltage-dependent tetrodotoxin-sensitive inward conductance.},

Neurons projecting from the striatum receive a large convergence of afferents from all areas of the cortex and transmit neural information to the basal ganglia output structures. Corticostriatal transmission is essential in the regulation of voluntary movement, in addition to behavioural control, cognitive function and reward mechanisms. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the two main forms of synaptic plasticity, are both represented at corticostriatal synapses and strongly depend on the activation of dopamine receptors. Here, we discuss possible feedforward and feedback mechanisms by which striatal interneurons, in association with striatal spiny neurons and endogenous dopamine, influence the formation and maintenance of both LTP and LTD. We also propose a model in which the spontaneous membrane oscillations of neurons projecting from the striatum (named 'up' and 'down' states), in addition to the pattern of release of endogenous dopamine, bias the synapse towards preferential induction of LTP or LTD. Finally, we discuss how endogenous dopamine crucially influences changes in synaptic plasticity induced by pathological stimuli, such as energy deprivation.},

  Abstract                 = {Our previous data indicate that there are specific features of the corticostriatal pathways from the prefrontal cortex. First, corticostriatal pathways are composed of focal, circumscribed projections and of diffuse, widespread projections. Second, there is some convergence between terminal fields from different functional regions of the prefrontal cortex. Third, anterior cingulate projections from area 24b occupy a large region of the rostral striatum. The goal of this study was to determine whether these features are also common to the corticostriatal projections from area 8A (including the frontal eye field; FEF), the supplementary eye field (SEF), dorsal and rostral premotor cortex (PMdr) and area 24c. Using a new approach of three-dimensional reconstruction of the corticostriatal pathways, along with dual cortical tracer injections, we mapped the corticostriatal terminal fields from areas 9 and 46, 8A-FEF, SEF, PMdr and 24b and c. In addition, we placed injections of retrogradely transported tracers into key striatal regions. The results demonstrated that: (i) a diffuse projection system is a common feature of the corticostriatal projections from different frontal regions; (ii) key striatal regions receive convergent projections from areas 9 and 46 and from areas 8A-FEF, SEF, PMdr and 24c, suggesting a potential pivotal role of these striatal regions in integrating cortical information; (iii) projections from area 24c, like those from area 24b, terminate widely throughout the striatum, interfacing with terminals from several frontal areas. These features of the corticostriatal frontal pathways suggest a potential integrative striatal network for learning.},

A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

  Abstract                 = {Emotions are multifaceted, but a key aspect of emotion involves the assessment of the value of environmental stimuli. This article reviews the many psychological representations, including representations of stimulus value, which are formed in the brain during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning tasks. These representations may be related directly to the functions of cortical and subcortical neural structures. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) appears to be required for a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) to gain access to the current value of the specific unconditioned stimulus (US) that it predicts, while the central nucleus of the amygdala acts as a controller of brainstem arousal and response systems, and subserves some forms of stimulus-response Pavlovian conditioning. The nucleus accumbens, which appears not to be required for knowledge of the contingency between instrumental actions and their outcomes, nevertheless influences instrumental behaviour strongly by allowing Pavlovian CSs to affect the level of instrumental responding (Pavlovian-instrumental transfer), and is required for the normal ability of animals to choose rewards that are delayed. The prelimbic cortex is required for the detection of instrumental action-outcome contingencies, while insular cortex may allow rats to retrieve the values of specific foods via their sensory properties. The orbitofrontal cortex, like the BLA, may represent aspects of reinforcer value that govern instrumental choice behaviour. Finally, the anterior cingulate cortex, implicated in human disorders of emotion and attention, may have multiple roles in responding to the emotional significance of stimuli and to errors in performance, preventing responding to inappropriate stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {As the desire for biologically realistic spiking neural networks (SNNs) increases, tuning the enormous number of open parameters in these models becomes a difficult challenge. SNNs have been used to successfully model complex neural circuits that explore various neural phenomena such as neural plasticity, vision systems, auditory systems, neural oscillations, and many other important topics of neural function. Additionally, SNNs are particularly well-adapted to run on neuromorphic hardware that will support biological brain-scale architectures. Although the inclusion of realistic plasticity equations, neural dynamics, and recurrent topologies has increased the descriptive power of SNNs, it has also made the task of tuning these biologically realistic SNNs difficult. To meet this challenge, we present an automated parameter tuning framework capable of tuning SNNs quickly and efficiently using evolutionary algorithms (EA) and inexpensive, readily accessible graphics processing units (GPUs). A sample SNN with 4104 neurons was tuned to give V1 simple cell-like tuning curve responses and produce self-organizing receptive fields (SORFs) when presented with a random sequence of counterphase sinusoidal grating stimuli. A performance analysis comparing the GPU-accelerated implementation to a single-threaded central processing unit (CPU) implementation was carried out and showed a speedup of 65× of the GPU implementation over the CPU implementation, or 0.35 h per generation for GPU vs. 23.5 h per generation for CPU. Additionally, the parameter value solutions found in the tuned SNN were studied and found to be stable and repeatable. The automated parameter tuning framework presented here will be of use to both the computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering communities, making the process of constructing and tuning large-scale SNNs much quicker and easier.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensory and premotor inputs to the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) were studied with retrograde axonal tracers. Restricted areas of the lateral and posterior orbital cortex had specific connections with visual-, somatosensory-, olfactory-, gustatory-, and visceral-related structures. More medial areas received few direct sensory inputs. Within the lateral and posterior orbital cortex, area 12l received a substantial projection from visual areas in the inferior temporal cortex (TE). Area 12m received somatosensory input from face, digit, or forelimb regions in the opercular part of area 1-2, in area 7b, in the second somatosensory area (SII), and in the anterior infraparietal area (AIP). Areas 13m and 13l also received a projection from the opercular part of areas 1-2 and 3b. The posteromedial and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm and Ial, respectively) received fibers from the ventral part of the parvicellular division of the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc) that may represent a visceral afferent system. The dorsal part of VPMpc projected to the adjacent gustatory cortex. These restricted inputs from several sensory modalities and the convergent corticocortical connections to orbital areas 13l and 13m suggest a network related to feeding. The OMPFC was also connected to premotor cortex in ventral area 6 (areas 6va and 6vb), in cingulate area 24c, and probably in the supplementary eye field. Area 6va projected to area 12m, whereas a region of area 6vb projected to area 13l. The region of the supplementary eye field projected to areas 12l, 12o, and 12r. Area Ial received fibers from area 24c. Lighter and more diffuse projections also reached wider areas of the OMPFC. For example, injections in several orbital areas labeled a few cells scattered through the anterior part of area TE and the superior temporal gyrus. There was also a projection to the intermediate agranular insular area (Iai) and to areas 13a and 12o from the apparently multimodal areas in the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have shown that the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) is extensively connected with medial temporal and cingulate limbic structures. In this study, the organization of these projections was defined in relation to architectonic areas within the OMPFC. All of the limbic structures were substantially connected with the following posterior and medial orbital areas: the posteromedial, medial, intermediate, and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm, Iam, Iai, and Ial, respectively) and areas 11m, 13a, 13b, 14c and 14r. In contrast, lateral orbital areas 12o, 12m, and 12l and medial wall areas 24a,b and 32 were primarily connected with the amygdala, the temporal pole, and the cingulate cortex. Data were not obtained on the posteroventral medial wall. Three distinct projections were recognized from the basal amygdaloid nucleus: 1) The dorsal part projected to area 12l; 2) the ventromedial part projected to most areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex except for area Iai, 12o, 13a, and 14c; and 3) the ventrolateral part projected to orbital areas 12o, Iai, 13a, 14c, and to the medial wall areas. The accessory basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei projected most strongly to areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex. The medial, anterior cortical, and central amygdaloid nuclei and the periamygdaloid cortex were connected with the posterior orbital areas. The projection from the hippocampus originated from the rostral subiculum and terminated in the medial orbital areas. The same region was reciprocally connected with the anteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, which received input from the rostral subiculum. The parahippocampal cortical areas (including the temporal polar, entorhinal, perirhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortices) were primarily connected with posterior and medial orbital areas, with some projections to the dorsal part of the medial wall. The rostral cingulate cortex sent fibers to the medial wall, to the medial orbital areas, and to lateral areas 12o, 12r, and Iai. The posterior cingulate gyrus, including the caudomedial lobule, was especially strongly connected with area 11m.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopamine-containing projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been extensively characterized since their discovery over 25 years ago. However, the VTA projection to the PFC also contains a substantial nondopamine component, whose neurochemical phenotype is unknown. To examine if a portion of this nondopamine VTA projection contains GABA, anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing in the rat was combined with GABA immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Following injections of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the PFC, many VTA neurons were retrogradely labeled, as visualized by immunoperoxidase staining for FG. A large portion of FG-labeled somata (58\%) and dendrites (33\%) within the VTA also contained immunogold-silver labeling for GABA. These dually labeled profiles exhibited a morphology similar to dopamine-containing cells within the VTA. To confirm and extend these findings, anterograde transport of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) from the VTA was combined with immunogold-silver labeling for GABA within the PFC. Consistent with the results obtained from retrograde tracing, a portion of BDA-labeled terminals in the PFC also contained immunoreactivity for GABA. These dually labeled terminals formed symmetric synapses onto small caliber dendrites and dendritic spines. Some PFC dendrites contacted by GABA-containing VTA terminals were themselves GABA-labeled. The results of this investigation have identified a substantial population of GABA-containing neurons in the VTA that send axons to the PFC where they synapse on the distal processes of both pyramidal and local circuit neurons. This GABA-containing mesocortical pathway may provide substrates for both inhibitory and disinhibitory influences on PFC neuronal activity.},

  Abstract                 = {The present experiments were designed to examine dopamine (DA) modulation of whole cell currents mediated by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in visualized neostriatal neurons in slices. First, we assessed the ability of DA, D1 and D2 receptor agonists to modulate membrane currents induced by activation of NMDA receptors. The results of these experiments demonstrated that DA potentiated NMDA-induced currents in medium-sized neostriatal neurons. Potentiation of NMDA currents occurred at three different holding potentials, although it was more pronounced at -30 mV. It was mediated by D1 receptors, because it was mimicked by D1 agonists and blocked by exposure to a D1 antagonist. Activation of D2 receptors produced inconsistent effects on NMDA-induced membrane currents. Either decreases, increases, or no effects on NMDA currents occurred. Second, we examined the contributions of intrinsic, voltage-dependent conductances to DA potentiation of NMDA currents. Blockade of K+ conductances did not prevent DA enhancement of NMDA currents. However, voltage-activated Ca2+ conductances provided a major contribution to DA modulation. The dihydropyridine L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, nifedipine, and methoxyverapamil (D-600), markedly reduced but did not totally eliminate the ability of DA to modulate NMDA currents. The D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 also enhanced Ba2+ currents in neostriatal neurons. Together, these findings provide evidence for a complex interplay between DA, NMDA receptor activation and dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ conductances in controlling responsiveness of neostriatal medium-sized neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {The responses of human neocortical neurons to iontophoretic application of excitatory amino acids and their modulation by dopamine (DA) were studied in vitro. Brain slices were obtained from children undergoing surgery for intractable epilepsy. Application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) to the slices induced slow depolarizations accompanied by decreased input conductances and sustained action potentials in cortical neurons. Glutamate produced rapid depolarizations and firing with few changes in input conductances. Quisqualate also induced depolarization and firing, but input conductances increased during the rising phase of the membrane depolarization. Iontophoretic application of DA alone produced no change in membrane potential or input conductance. However, when DA was applied in conjunction with the excitatory amino acids, it produced contrasting effects. With either bath application of DA or when iontophoresis of DA preceded application of NMDA, the amplitude of the membrane depolarizations and the number of action potentials were increased, whereas the latency of these responses decreased. In contrast, DA decreased the amplitude of the depolarizations and the number of action potentials evoked by glutamate or quisqualate. The fact that DA affects responses to NMDA and glutamate or quisqualate in opposite directions is of considerable importance to the understanding of cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation and the role of DA in cognitive processing and in epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucially involved in the executive component of working memory, representation of task state, and behavior selection. This article presents a large-scale computational model of the PFC and associated brain regions designed to investigate the mechanisms by which working memory and task state interact to select adaptive behaviors from a behavioral repertoire. The model consists of multiple brain regions containing neuronal populations with realistic physiological and anatomical properties, including extrastriate visual cortical regions, the inferotemporal cortex, the PFC, the striatum, and midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. The onset of a delayed match-to-sample or delayed nonmatch-to-sample task triggers tonic DA release in the PFC causing a switch into a persistent, stimulus-insensitive dynamic state that promotes the maintenance of stimulus representations within prefrontal networks. Other modeled prefrontal and striatal units select cognitive acceptance or rejection behaviors according to which task is active and whether prefrontal working memory representations match the current stimulus. Working memory task performance and memory fields of prefrontal delay units are degraded by extreme elevation or depletion of tonic DA levels. Analyses of cellular and synaptic activity suggest that hyponormal DA levels result in increased prefrontal activation, whereas hypernormal DA levels lead to decreased activation. Our simulation results suggest a range of predictions for behavioral, single-cell, and neuroimaging response data under the proposed task set and under manipulations of DA concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {Research on the neural basis of working memory (WM) has generally focused on neocortical regions; comparatively little is known about the role of subcortical structures. There is growing evidence that the basal ganglia are involved in WM, but their contribution to different component processes of WM is poorly understood. We examined the temporal dynamics of basal ganglia response and connectivity during the encoding, maintenance and response phases of a Sternberg WM task. During the encoding and maintenance phases, WM-load-dependent activation was observed in the left anterior caudate, anterior putamen and globus pallidus; activation in the right anterior caudate was observed only during the maintenance phase. During the response phase, the basal ganglia were equally active in both the high-load and low-load WM conditions. Caudate and putamen activations were primarily localized to the (rostral) associative parts of the basal ganglia, consistent with the putative role of these regions in cognitive processing. Effective connectivity analyses revealed increased WM-load-dependent interaction of the left anterior caudate with the left posterior parietal cortex during all three phases of the task; with the visual association cortex, including the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus, only during the encoding phase; with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the encoding and maintenance phases; with the pre-supplementary motor area during the maintenance and response phases; and with the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices only during the response phase. Taken together with known neuroanatomy of the basal ganglia, these results suggest that the anterior caudate helps to link signals in distinct functional networks during different phases of the WM task. Our study offers new insight into the integrative and adaptive role of the basal ganglia in higher cognitive function.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrophysiological recording of single neuron activity has been conducted in rats to investigate the patterns of distributed neuronal responses in the frontal cortico-basal ganglia system that code information during a spatial-delayed matching-to-sample task (DMTSt). Rats were trained to press one of the two retractable levers presented randomly as a sample response. The first valid nose-poke after a delay resulted in the presentation of both levers. Pressing the same lever as the sample lever led to a water reward (match to sample), whereas pressing the lever opposite the sample lever resulted in a time-out (house light turned off). One hundred seventy-one neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), 51 in the dorsal striatum (STR), and 93 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were recorded during DMTSt. Different patterns of neuronal responses were observed during different behavioral episodes (sample, delay, and match phases) in all three recording areas. Space-related neuronal responses specific to the side of the lever pressed were more often found in the sample phase than in the match phase in all three areas studied. Neuronal responses specific to either correct or error trials were observed with similar percentages in the mPFC and the NAc, while the incidence of correct/error-coded activity in the STR was lower. Ensemble neuronal activity that coded sample versus match lever presses was observed in three out of five rats in sets of trials with similar speed and trajectory of lever press. The results reveal specific patterns of neural responses in the frontal cortico-basal ganglia system in rats during the DMTSt and suggest the existence of specific neuronal coding for different behavioral events associated with a learned short-term memory process.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopamine (DA) plays an essential role in the control of coordinated movements. Alterations in DA balance in the striatum lead to pathological conditions such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases (HD). HD is a progressive, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a genetic mutation producing an expansion of glutamine repeats and is characterized by abnormal dance-like movements (chorea). The principal pathology is the loss of striatal and cortical projection neurons. Changes in brain DA content and receptor number contribute to abnormal movements and cognitive deficits in HD. In particular, during the early hyperkinetic stage of HD, DA levels are increased whereas expression of DA receptors is reduced. In contrast, in the late akinetic stage, DA levels are significantly decreased and resemble those of a Parkinsonian state. Time-dependent changes in DA transmission parallel biphasic changes in glutamate synaptic transmission and may enhance alterations in glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic activity. In this review, we focus on neuronal electrophysiological mechanisms that may lead to some of the motor and cognitive symptoms of HD and how they relate to dysfunction in DA neurotransmission. Based on clinical and experimental findings, we propose that some of the behavioral alterations in HD, including reduced behavioral flexibility, may be caused by altered DA modulatory function. Thus, restoring DA balance alone or in conjunction with glutamate receptor antagonists could be a viable therapeutic approach.},

This approach yielded several new results. First, the global distributions of labeled terminals revealed that both TEad and TEav projected to the ventrocaudal striatum, including the tail of the caudate nucleus and the adjacent ventral putamen, and the dorsolateral aspect of the deep amygdaloid nuclei. TEav also projected to the medial basal nucleus of the amygdala and the ventral striatum. Second, the reconstructed single axons (n = 18) demonstrated that some axons originating from TEav or TEad projected simultaneously to the ventrocaudal striatum and the dorsolateral aspect of the deep amygdaloid nuclei by giving off collaterals. TEav axons projected to the medial basal nucleus of the amygdala also had collaterals projecting to the perirhinal cortex or area TG. And third, it was revealed that the axons originating from a focal TEav or TEad projected to a restricted territory (3.4-3.6 mm rostrocaudally) in the ventrocaudal striatum with four to six dispersed, rostrocaudally elongated, rod-like modules. Individual axons with multiple arbors innervated many of these modules. These findings add the evidence that the anterior part of TE is anatomically heterogeneous and suggest that the deep amygdaloid nuclei may be functionally dissociated, with the dorsolateral aspect more closely related to the ventrocaudal striatum and the medial basal nucleus more closely related to the perirhinal cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian substantia nigra display characteristic phasic responses to stimuli which reliably predict the receipt of primary rewards. These responses have been suggested to encode reward prediction-errors similar to those used in reinforcement learning. Here, we propose a model of dopaminergic activity in which prediction-error signals are generated by the joint action of short-latency excitation and long-latency inhibition, in a network undergoing dopaminergic neuromodulation of both spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. In contrast to previous models, sensitivity to recent events is maintained by the selective modification of specific striatal synapses, efferent to cortical neurons exhibiting stimulus-specific, temporally extended activity patterns. Our model shows, in the presence of significant background activity, (i) a shift in dopaminergic response from reward to reward-predicting stimuli, (ii) preservation of a response to unexpected rewards, and (iii) a precisely timed below-baseline dip in activity observed when expected rewards are omitted.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical conditioning of the eyeblink reflex to a neutral stimulus that predicts an aversive stimulus is a basic form of associative learning. Acquisition and retention of this learned response require the cerebellum and associated sensory and motor pathways and engage several other brain regions including the hippocampus, neocortex, neostriatum, septum, and amygdala. The cerebellum and its associated circuitry form the essential neural system for delay eyeblink conditioning. Trace eyeblink conditioning, a learning paradigm in which the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli are noncontiguous, requires both the cerebellum and the hippocampus and exhibits striking parallels to declarative memory formation in humans. Identification of the neural structures critical to the development and maintenance of the conditioned eyeblink response is an essential precursor to the investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these associative memories. In this review, we describe the evidence used to identify the neural substrates of classical eyeblink conditioning and potential mechanisms of memory formation in critical regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum. Addressing a central goal of behavioral neuroscience, exploitation of this simple yet robust model of learning and memory has yielded one of the most comprehensive descriptions to date of the physical basis of a learned behavior in mammals.},

However, the precise temporal landscape of their electrophysiological interactions in humans remains unknown because it is not possible to record neural activity from the nucleus accumbens using noninvasive techniques. We recorded electrophysiological activity simultaneously from the nucleus accumbens and cortex (via surface EEG) in humans who had electrodes implanted as part of deep-brain-stimulation treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Patients performed a simple reward motivation task previously shown to activate the ventral striatum. Spectral Granger causality analyses were applied to dissociate "top-down" (cortex ? nucleus accumbens)- from "bottom-up" (nucleus accumbens ? cortex)-directed synchronization (functional connectivity). "Top-down"-directed synchrony from cortex to nucleus accumbens was maximal over medial frontal sites and was significantly stronger when rewards were anticipated. These findings provide direct electrophysiological evidence for a role of the MFC in modulating nucleus accumbens reward-related processing and may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms of deep-brain stimulation and its beneficial effects on psychiatric conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The source of short-latency visual input to midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons is not currently known; however, the superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical visual structure which has response latencies consistently shorter than those recorded for DA neurons in substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. To test whether the SC represents a plausible route by which visual information may gain short latency access to the ventral midbrain, the present study examined whether experimental stimulation of the SC can influence the activity of midbrain DA neurons. In urethane-anaesthetized rats, 63 pairs of extracellular recordings were obtained from neurons in the SC and ipsilateral ventral midbrain, before and after local disinhibitory injections of the GABA antagonist bicuculline (20-40 ng/200-400 nL saline) into the SC. Neurons recorded from substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area were classified as putative DA (25/63, 39.7\%) or putative non-DA (38/63, 60.3\%). In nearly half the cases (27/63, 42.8\%), chemical stimulation of the SC evoked a corresponding increase in neural activity in the ventral midbrain. This excitatory effect did not distinguish between DA and non-DA neurons. In 6/63 cases (9.5\%), SC activation elicited a reliable suppression of activity, while the remaining 30/63 cases (47.6\%) were unaffected. In almost a third of cases (16/57, 28.1\%) intense phasic activation of the SC was associated with correlated phasic activation of neurons in substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. These data suggest that the SC is in a position to play an important role in discriminating the appropriate stimulus qualities required to activate DA cells at short latency.},

Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331-349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Tests of Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) demonstrate that reward-predictive stimuli can exert a powerful motivational influence on the performance of instrumental actions. Recent evidence suggests that predictive stimuli produce this effect through either the general arousal (general PIT) or the specific predictions (outcome-specific PIT) produced by their association with reward. In two experiments, we examined the effects of pretraining lesions (Experiment 1) or muscimol-induced inactivation (Experiment 2) of either the core or shell regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) on these forms of PIT. Rats received Pavlovian training in which three auditory stimuli each predicted the delivery of a distinct food outcome. Separately, the rats were trained to perform two instrumental actions, each of which earned one of the outcomes used in Pavlovian conditioning. Finally, the effects of the three stimuli on performance of the two actions were assessed in extinction. Here we report evidence of a double dissociation between general and outcome-specific PIT at the level of the accumbens. Shell lesions eliminated outcome-specific PIT but spared general PIT, whereas lesions of the core abolished general PIT but spared outcome-specific PIT. Importantly, the infusion of muscimol into core or shell made immediately before the PIT tests produced a similar pattern of results. These results suggest that whereas the NAC core mediates the general excitatory effects of reward-related cues, the NAC shell mediates the effect of outcome-specific reward predictions on instrumental performance, and thereby serve to clarify reported discrepancies regarding the role of the NAC core and shell in PIT.},

It is an almost uniquely intangible sensation: we cannot see time in the way that we see color, shape, or even location. So how is time represented in the brain? We explore the neural substrates of metrical representations of time such as duration estimation (explicit timing) or temporal expectation (implicit timing). Basal ganglia (BG), supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have all been linked to the explicit estimation of duration. However, each region may have a functionally discrete role and will be differentially implicated depending upon task context. Among these, the dorsal striatum of the BG and, more specifically, its ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway seems to be the most crucial of these regions, as shown by converging functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychopharmacological investigations in humans, as well as lesion and pharmacological studies in animals. Moreover, neuronal firing rates in both striatal and interconnected frontal areas vary as a function of duration, suggesting a neurophysiological mechanism for the representation of time in the brain, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance of interactions among distinct subtypes of striatal neuron serving to fine-tune temporal accuracy and precision.},

The neural mechanisms of cognitive control have yet to be fully elucidated, although the prefrontal cortex is known to play a critical role. Here, I review evidence suggesting that a unifying principle regarding the role of various portions of the prefrontal cortex in a wide range of cognitive tasks is the active maintenance in working memory of different types of currently relevant information-from specific stimulus features, to instructional cues, to motivational goals and contexts. I argue that the key to demonstrating the existence of this domain-dependent organization lies in a better understanding of the nature of the representation of this information and the ways in which this information itself controls cognition and behavior.},

Visual working memory tasks, in which subjects retain the memory of a stimulus over brief delays, require both the perceptual encoding of the stimulus and the subsequent maintenance of its representation after the stimulus is removed from view. Such tasks activate multiple areas in visual and prefrontal cortices. To delineate the roles these areas play in perception and working memory maintenance, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain dynamic measures of neural activity related to different components of a face working memory task-non-selective transient responses to visual stimuli, selective transient responses to faces, and sustained responses over memory delays. Three occipitotemporal areas in the ventral object vision pathway had mostly transient responses to stimuli, indicating their predominant role in perceptual processing, whereas three prefrontal areas demonstrated sustained activity over memory delays, indicating their predominant role in working memory. This distinction, however, was not absolute. Additionally, the visual areas demonstrated different degrees of selectivity, and the prefrontal areas demonstrated different strengths of sustained activity, revealing a continuum of functional specialization, from occipital through multiple prefrontal areas, regarding each area's relative contribution to perceptual and mnemonic processing.},

  Abstract                 = {Object recognition is the canonical test of declarative memory, the type of memory putatively impaired after damage to the temporal lobes. Studies of object recognition memory have helped elucidate the anatomical structures involved in declarative memory, indicating a critical role for perirhinal cortex. We offer a mechanistic account of the effects of perirhinal cortex damage on object recognition memory, based on the assumption that perirhinal cortex stores representations of the conjunctions of visual features possessed by complex objects. Such representations are proposed to play an important role in memory when it is difficult to solve a task using representations of only individual visual features of stimuli, thought to be stored in regions of the ventral visual stream caudal to perirhinal cortex. The account is instantiated in a connectionist model, in which development of object representations with visual experience provides a mechanism for judgment of previous occurrence. We present simulations addressing the following empirical findings: (1) that impairments after damage to perirhinal cortex (modeled by removing the "perirhinal cortex" layer of the network) are exacerbated by lengthening the delay between presentation of to-be-remembered items and test, (2) that such impairments are also exacerbated by lengthening the list of to-be-remembered items, and (3) that impairments are revealed only when stimuli are trial unique rather than repeatedly presented. This study shows that it may be possible to account for object recognition impairments after damage to perirhinal cortex within a hierarchical, representational framework, in which complex conjunctive representations in perirhinal cortex play a critical role.},

  Abstract                 = {Mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and striatal cholinergic neurons (tonically active neurons, TANs) participate in signalling the behavioural or reward-related significance of stimuli in the environment. An antagonistic balance between dopamine (DA) and ACh is well known to regulate postsynaptic signal integration in the striatum. Recent findings have revealed additional presynaptic ACh-DA interactions of previously unappreciated sophistication. Striatal ACh acts presynaptically to polarize powerfully how opposing DAN activities are transduced into DA release. Furthermore, characteristic reward-related activities of TANs and DANs are temporally coincident but differently variant with reward probability. Reward-related DA signals could therefore be governed by the concomitant activity in TANs. This article discusses the dynamic implications for DA signalling when these phenomena act in concert. TAN pauses might powerfully enhance the contrast, or salience, of DA signals offered by reward-related bursts, and even by reward omission-related pauses, in DANs. Through such mechanisms, TAN-DAN interactions would be functionally cooperative.},

  Abstract                 = {In behavioral science, it is well known that humans and nonhuman animals are highly sensitive to differences in reward magnitude when choosing an outcome from a set of alternatives. We know that a realm of behavioral reactions is altered when animals begin to expect different levels of reward outcome. Our present aim was to investigate how the expectation for different magnitudes of reward influences behavior-related neurophysiology in the anterior striatum. In a spatial delayed response task, different instruction pictures are presented to the monkey. Each image represents a different magnitude of juice. By reaching to the spatial location where an instruction picture was presented, animals could receive the particular liquid amount designated by the stimulus. Reliable preferences in reward choice trials and differences in anticipatory licks, performance errors, and reaction times indicated that animals differentially expected the various reward amounts predicted by the instruction cues. A total of 374 of 2,000 neurons in the anterior parts of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum showed five forms of task-related activation during the preparation or execution of movement and activations preceding or following the liquid drop delivery. Approximately one-half of these striatal neurons showed differing response levels dependent on the magnitude of liquid to be received. Results of a linear regression analysis showed that reward magnitude and single cell discharge rate were related in a subset of neurons by a monotonic positive or negative relationship. Overall, these data support the idea that the striatum utilizes expectancies that contain precise information concerning the predicted, forthcoming level of reward in directing general behavioral reactions.},

Many studies of neuroscientific and neural prosthetic importance rely on a smoothed, denoised estimate of a spike train's underlying firing rate. Numerous methods for estimating neural firing rates have been developed in recent years, but to date no systematic comparison has been made between them. In this study, we review both classic and current firing rate estimation techniques. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these methods. Then, in an effort to understand their relevance to the field of neural prostheses, we also apply these estimators to experimentally gathered neural data from a prosthetic arm-reaching paradigm. Using these estimates of firing rate, we apply standard prosthetic decoding algorithms to compare the performance of the different firing rate estimators, and, perhaps surprisingly, we find minimal differences. This study serves as a review of available spike train smoothers and a first quantitative comparison of their performance for brain-machine interfaces.},

We critically evaluate how well recent findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies are compatible with current models of the role of the DLFPC in working memory. These new findings suggest that the DLPFC aids in the maintenance of information by directing attention to internal representations of sensory stimuli and motor plans that are stored in more posterior regions.}

This review will consider recent data suggesting that the ERC and PRC, far from being passive relay stations, actively gate impulse traffic between neocortex and hippocampus, because they are endowed with a powerful intrinsic inhibitory system. It is proposed that the cross-talk between PRC and ERC is not organized to unrestrictedly transfer information, but to select relevant inputs. The implication of these new evidences for the propagation of epileptiform activity will be considered.},

We found that PFC lesions did not affect storage processes--which is consistent with the notion that posterior cortical networks can support simple retention of information. We also found that PFC lesions did not affect rehearsal/maintenance processes, which was in contrast to our finding that healthy subjects performing a verbal delayed recognition task showed bilateral PFC activation. These combined imaging and behavioral data suggest that working memory rehearsal/maintenance processes may depend on both hemispheres, which may have implications for recovery of function and development of rehabilitation therapies after frontal injury.},

Some authors believe that learning the CS–US interval is a co-requisite of or a pre-requisite to learning the CS–US association. There is a substantial literature showing that the amygdala is a critical player in Pavlovian conditioning, with both aversive and appetitive USs. We review a sparse but growing body of literature suggesting that the amygdala may also participate in processing the timing of the CS–US interval. We discuss whether the amygdala, in particular its central, basal and lateral nuclei, in concert with the network it belongs to, may play a role in learning the CS–US interval. We also suggest new and dedicated strategies that would result in better knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying the learning of the CS–US time interval in isolation from the CS–US association.

  Abstract                 = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and data-management tools. PyNN increases the reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple simulators.

  Abstract                 = {Although the responses of dopamine neurons in the primate midbrain are well characterized as carrying a temporal difference (TD) error signal for reward prediction, existing theories do not offer a credible account of how the brain keeps track of past sensory events that may be relevant to predicting future reward. Empirically, these shortcomings of previous theories are particularly evident in their account of experiments in which animals were exposed to variation in the timing of events. The original theories mispredicted the results of such experiments due to their use of a representational device called a tapped delay line. Here we propose that a richer understanding of history representation and a better account of these experiments can be given by considering TD algorithms for a formal setting that incorporates two features not originally considered in theories of the dopaminergic response: partial observability (a distinction between the animal's sensory experience and the true underlying state of the world) and semi-Markov dynamics (an explicit account of variation in the intervals between events). The new theory situates the dopaminergic system in a richer functional and anatomical context, since it assumes (in accord with recent computational theories of cortex) that problems of partial observability and stimulus history are solved in sensory cortex using statistical modeling and inference and that the TD system predicts reward using the results of this inference rather than raw sensory data. It also accounts for a range of experimental data, including the experiments involving programmed temporal variability and other previously unmodeled dopaminergic response phenomena, which we suggest are related to subjective noise in animals' interval timing. Finally, it offers new experimental predictions and a rich theoretical framework for designing future experiments.},

However, such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. Here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience. The trade-off is realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. We suggest a Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate. This provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.},

  Abstract                 = {This article addresses the relationship between long-term reward predictions and slow-timescale neural activity in temporal difference (TD) models of the dopamine system. Such models attempt to explain how the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons relates to errors in the prediction of future rewards. Previous models have been mostly restricted to short-term predictions of rewards expected during a single, somewhat artificially defined trial. Also, the models focused exclusively on the phasic pause-and-burst activity of primate DA neurons; the neurons' slower, tonic background activity was assumed to be constant. This has led to difficulty in explaining the results of neurochemical experiments that measure indications of DA release on a slow timescale, results that seem at first glance inconsistent with a reward prediction model. In this article, we investigate a TD model of DA activity modified so as to enable it to make longer-term predictions about rewards expected far in the future. We show that these predictions manifest themselves as slow changes in the baseline error signal, which we associate with tonic DA activity. Using this model, we make new predictions about the behavior of the DA system in a number of experimental situations. Some of these predictions suggest new computational explanations for previously puzzling data, such as indications from microdialysis studies of elevated DA activity triggered by aversive events.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to form associations between predictive environmental events and rewarding outcomes is a fundamental aspect of learned behavior. This apparently simple ability likely requires complex neural processing evolved to identify, seek, and use natural rewards and redirect these activities based on updated sensory information. Emerging evidence from both animal and human research suggests that this type of processing is mediated in part by the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and a closely associated network of brain structures. The NAc is required for a number of reward-related behaviors and processes specific information about reward availability, value, and context. In addition, this structure is critical for the acquisition and expression of most Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships, and cues that predict rewards produce robust changes in neural activity in the NAc. Although processing within the NAc may enable or promote Pavlovian reward learning in natural situations, it has also been implicated in aspects of human drug addiction, including the ability of drug-paired cues to control behavior. This article provides a critical review of the existing animal and human literature concerning the role of the NAc in Pavlovian learning with nondrug rewards and considers some clinical ture concerning the role of the NAc in Pavlovian learning with nondrug implications of these findings.},

Comparisons and contrasts between individually identified NA neuron responses to cocaine self-administration and water reinforcement are presented with an emphasis on the fact that the same neurons do not respond in a phasic manner to both types of rewards. However, the phasic firing patterns, even though segregated for each reinforcer, are quite similar, suggesting that the method of differentiation between rewarding stimuli in the NA is by sorting cell populations into distinct ensembles or networks for each type of reinforcer. These neural networks appear to be ‘tuned’ to respond to particular associative behavioral contexts that couple response execution to reward delivery, and in the process acquire a reciprocity to firing within reward contexts. This maintains the specificity of each reinforcer for the response and associated stimuli that produce it and, makes it possible to attach different NA networks to different reinforcing circumstances. Comparisons of cocaine and water reinforced NA cell firing patterns during rapid switching between these two reinforcers suggests that the networks are negatively coupled and mutually inhibit each other to maintain accurate encoding of immediately experienced, as well as expected (i.e. future) reward contingencies.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent mapping between sensory stimuli and actions. The same stimulus can lead to different behaviours depending on the situation, or the same behaviour may be elicited by different cueing stimuli. Neurons in the primate prefrontal cortex show task-specific firing activity during working memory delay periods. These neurons provide a neural substrate for mapping stimulus and response in a flexible, context- or rule-dependent, fashion. We describe here an integrate-and-fire network model to explain and investigate the different types of working-memory-related neuronal activity observed. The model contains different populations (or pools) of neurons (as found neurophysiologically) in attractor networks which respond in the delay period to the stimulus object, the stimulus position ('sensory pools'), to combinations of the stimulus sensory properties (e.g. the object identity or object location) and the response ('intermediate pools'), and to the response required (left or right) ('premotor pools'). The pools are arranged hierarchically, are linked by associative synaptic connections, and have global inhibition through inhibitory interneurons to implement competition. It is shown that a biasing attentional input to define the current rule applied to the intermediate pools enables the system to select the correct response in what is a biased competition model of attention. The integrate-and-fire model not only produces realistic spiking dynamicals very similar to the neuronal data but also shows how dopamine could weaken and shorten the persistent neuronal activity in the delay period; and allows us to predict more response errors when dopamine is elevated because there is less different activity in the different pools of competing neurons, resulting in more conflict.},

Their performances in visual search tasks suggested that they suffered from a deficit of serial visual exploration, due to a fundamental inability to use spatial tags to keep track of previously explored locations.

  Abstract                 = {The human striatum has been implicated in processing reward-related information. More recently, activity in the striatum, particularly the caudate nucleus, has been observed when a contingency between behavior and reward exists, suggesting a role for the caudate in reinforcement-based learning. Using a gambling paradigm, in which affective feedback (reward and punishment) followed simple, random guesses on a trial by trial basis, we sought to investigate the role of the caudate nucleus as reward-related learning progressed. Participants were instructed to make a guess regarding the value of a presented card (if the value of the card was higher or lower than 5). They were told that five different cues would be presented prior to making a guess, and that each cue indicated the probability that the card would be high or low. The goal was to learn the contingencies and maximize the reward attained. Accuracy, as measured by participant's choices, improved throughout the experiment for cues that strongly predicted reward, while no change was observed for unpredictable cues. Event-related fMRI revealed that activity in the caudate nucleus was more robust during the early phases of learning, irrespective of contingencies, suggesting involvement of this region during the initial stages of trial and error learning. Further, the reward feedback signal in the caudate nucleus for well-learned cues decreased as learning progressed, suggesting an evolving adaptation of reward feedback expectancy as a behavior-outcome contingency becomes more predictable.},

The basal ganglia are now appreciated as components of parallel, reentrant cortico-subcortical circuits, which originate from individual cortical areas, traverse the basal ganglia and thalamus, and terminate in their respective areas of origin in the frontal lobe. Further research and clinical experience have resulted in new insights and perspectives on the details of the circuitry and on the role of these structures in Parkinson disease and other basal ganglia disorders. On the basis of anatomical and physiological studies and the striking success of focused surgical interventions, it seems appropriate to view these varied clinical disorders as circuit disorders, resulting from pathologic disturbances in neuronal activity throughout specific cortico-subcortical loops.},

In the last decade, progress on the anatomical organization and functional properties of BG output neurons have shed some light on the mechanisms of integration taking place in these nuclei and leading to normal and pathological BG outflow. In this review focused on the SNr, after describing how the anatomical arrangement of nigral cells and their afferents determines specific input-output registers, we examine how the basic electrophysiological properties of the cells and their interaction with synaptic inputs contribute to the spatio-temporal shaping of BG output. The reported data show that the intrinsic membrane properties of the neurons subserves a tonic discharge allowing BG to gate the transmission of information to motor and cognitive systems thereby contributing to appropriate selection of behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The striatum is the major division of the basal ganglia, representing the input station of the circuit and arguably the principal site within the basal ganglia where information processing occurs. Striatal activity is critically involved in motor control and learning. Many parts of the striatum are involved in reward processing and in various forms of learning and memory, such as reward-association learning. Moreover, the striatum appears to be a brain center for habit formation and is likely to be involved in advanced stages of addiction. The critical role played by the striatum in learning and cognitive processes is thought to be based on changes in neuronal activity when specific behavioral tasks are being learned. Accordingly, excitatory corticostriatal synapses onto both striatal projecting spiny neurons and interneurons are able to undergo the main forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, long-term depression, short-term forms of intrinsic plasticity and spike timing-dependent plasticity. These specific forms of neuroplasticity allow the short-term and long-term selection and differential amplification of cortical neural signals modulating the processes of motor and behavioral selection within the basal ganglia neural circuit.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous neurochemical and behavioral studies suggest that muscarinic receptor antagonism has an excitatory effect on the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. Using in vivo extracellular single unit recording, this study examined whether blockade of the muscarinic receptor by scopolamine alters the firing properties of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Scopolamine was administered either systemically or locally to DA neurons using microiontophoresis. Surprisingly, scopolamine did not cause any significant change in either the firing rate or pattern of the spontaneously active DA neurons. However, systemic injection of scopolamine significantly increased the number of active DA neurons in the SN. Local infusion of scopolamine into the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) mimicked the effect induced by systemically administered scopolamine, significantly increasing the number of active DA neurons without altering the firing rate and pattern. These results suggest that the reported increase in striatal DA release induced by scopolamine is in part mediated by activation of silent nigral DA neurons. The experiments with PPT local infusion further suggest that part of the effect of scopolamine may be due to its blockade of the inhibitory muscarinic autoreceptors on PPT cholinergic cells. The latter effect may lead to activation of quiescent DA neurons by increasing acetylcholine (ACh) release in the SN or in other brain areas providing inputs to DA neurons. Further understanding of the mechanism of action of scopolamine may help us further understand the role of ACh in both the pathophysiology and treatment of DA-related disorders including schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.},

Over the past years, a number of efforts have focused on developing parallel algorithms and simulators best suited for the simulation of spiking neural models. In this article, we aim at investigating the advantages and drawbacks of the CPU and GPU parallelization of mean-firing rate neurons, widely used in systems-level computational neuroscience. By comparing OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL implementations towards a serial CPU implementation, we show that GPUs are better suited than CPUs for the simulation of very large networks, but that smaller networks would benefit more from an OpenMP implementation. As this performance strongly depends on data organization, we analyze the impact of various factors such as data structure, memory alignment and floating precision. We then discuss the suitability of the different hardware depending on the networks' size and connectivity, as random or sparse connectivities in mean-firing rate networks tend to break parallel performance on GPUs due to the violation of coalescence.},

The algebra provides operators to form more complex sets of connections from simpler ones and also provides parameterization of such sets. CSA is expressive enough to describe a wide range of connection patterns, including multiple types of random and/or geometrically dependent connectivity, and can serve as a concise notation for network structure in scientific writing. CSA implementations allow for scalable and efficient representation of connectivity in parallel neuronal network simulators and could even allow for avoiding explicit representation of connections in computer memory. The expressiveness of CSA makes prototyping of network structure easy. A C+ + version of the algebra has been implemented and used in a large-scale neuronal network simulation (Djurfeldt et al., IBM J Res Dev 52(1/2):31-42, 2008b) and an implementation in Python has been publicly released.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulator-independent descriptions of connectivity in neuronal networks promise greater ease of model sharing, improved reproducibility of simulation results, and reduced programming effort for computational neuroscientists. However, until now, enabling the use of such descriptions in a given simulator in a computationally efficient way has entailed considerable work for simulator developers, which must be repeated for each new connectivity-generating library that is developed. We have developed a generic connection generator interface that provides a standard way to connect a connectivity-generating library to a simulator, such that one library can easily be replaced by another, according to the modeler's needs. We have used the connection generator interface to connect C++ and Python implementations of the previously described connection-set algebra to the NEST simulator. We also demonstrate how the simulator-independent modeling framework PyNN can transparently take advantage of this, passing a connection description through to the simulator layer for rapid processing in C++ where a simulator supports the connection generator interface and falling-back to slower iteration in Python otherwise. A set of benchmarks demonstrates the good performance of the interface.},

Although this signal is important for reinforcement learning, the information it conveys to forebrain target structures remains uncertain. One way to decode the phasic DA signal would be to determine the perceptual properties of sensory inputs to DA neurons. After local disinhibition of the superior colliculus in anesthetized rats, DA neurons became visually responsive, whereas disinhibition of the visual cortex was ineffective. As the primary source of visual afferents, the limited processing capacities of the colliculus may constrain the visual information content of phasic DA responses.},

  Abstract                 = {The activity of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) neurons was recorded in three unrestrained cats operantly conditioned to perform a lever-release movement. The movement had to be initiated either rapidly after a (click) stimulus in a simple reaction-time paradigm or had to be delayed after the same stimulus in trials identified by a tone cue. Successful trials were rewarded by a food pellet. A total of 107 neurons were recorded with microelectrodes. Brief spike neurons (mean duration: 0.7 ms) and broad spike neurons (mean duration: 2 ms) presumed to be cholinergic were detected. Of the 73 neurons localized in the PPTg area, 53 had brief spikes and 20 broad spikes. Changes in activity most commonly occurred very early after the stimulus or during the reinforcement process. Most neurons with brief spikes exhibited very early excitation after the stimulus and reinforcement-related activity. These neurons had a mean activity of 23.7 impulses/s in the period preceding the stimulus. The onset of activation after the stimulus had a latency of 8.6+/-6.9 ms (mean+/-SD), with a range of 4-35 ms. In trials where the movement had to be delayed after the stimulus, the early activation disappeared or was considerably reduced, showing that it was context-dependent. A small proportion of neurons with brief spikes initially decreased activity after the stimulus, but with a latency >9 ms. All the neurons with broad spikes, except one, had reinforcement-related activity. Half of them showed exclusively reinforcement-related activity, the other half also early activation after the stimulus. These neurons were about half as active in the period preceding the stimulus occurrence than the neurons with brief spikes. The early context-dependent activation is discussed in relation to the excitatory projection of PPTg neurons on the subthalamic nucleus. The reinforcement-related activity, preferentially evidenced in broad spike neurons presumed to be cholinergic, is speculated to be associated with cholinergic projection of PPTg neurons to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Finally, the role of PPTg in the ongoing control of motor performance and reinforcement processes is discussed in relation to the basal ganglia circuitry.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-term memory underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning is believed to involve plasticity at sensory input synapses in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). A useful physiological model for studying synaptic plasticity is long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP in the LA has been studied only in vitro or in anaesthetized rats. Here, we tested whether LTP can be induced in auditory input pathways to the LA in awake rats, and if so, whether it persists over days. In chronically implanted rats, extracellular field potentials evoked in the LA by stimulation of the auditory thalamus and the auditory association cortex, using test simulations and input/output (I/O) curves, were compared in the same animals after tetanization of either pathway alone or after combined tetanization. For both pathways, LTP was input-specific and long lasting. LTP at cortical inputs exhibited the largest change at early time points (24 h) but faded within 3 days. In contrast, LTP at thalamic inputs, though smaller initially than cortical LTP, remained stable until at least 6 days. Comparisons of I/O curves indicated that the two pathways may rely on different mechanisms for the maintenance of LTP and may benefit differently from their coactivation. This is the first report of LTP at sensory inputs to the LA in awake animals. The results reveal important characteristics of synaptic plasticity in neuronal circuits of fear memory that could not have been revealed with in vitro preparations, and suggest a differential role of thalamic and cortical auditory afferents in long-term memory of fear conditioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals are motivated to choose environmental options that can best satisfy current needs. To explain such choices, this paper introduces the MOTIVATOR (Matching Objects To Internal VAlues Triggers Option Revaluations) neural model. MOTIVATOR describes cognitive-emotional interactions between higher-order sensory cortices and an evaluative neuraxis composed of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex. Given a conditioned stimulus (CS), the model amygdala and lateral hypothalamus interact to calculate the expected current value of the subjective outcome that the CS predicts, constrained by the current state of deprivation or satiation. The amygdala relays the expected value information to orbitofrontal cells that receive inputs from anterior inferotemporal cells, and medial orbitofrontal cells that receive inputs from rhinal cortex. The activations of these orbitofrontal cells code the subjective values of objects. These values guide behavioral choices. The model basal ganglia detect errors in CS-specific predictions of the value and timing of rewards. Excitatory inputs from the pedunculopontine nucleus interact with timed inhibitory inputs from model striosomes in the ventral striatum to regulate dopamine burst and dip responses from cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Learning in cortical and striatal regions is strongly modulated by dopamine. The model is used to address tasks that examine food-specific satiety, Pavlovian conditioning, reinforcer devaluation, and simultaneous visual discrimination. Model simulations successfully reproduce discharge dynamics of known cell types, including signals that predict saccadic reaction times and CS-dependent changes in systolic blood pressure.},

  Abstract                 = {Working memory performance is modulated by the level of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors stimulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This modulation is exerted at different time scales. Injection of D1 agonists/antagonists exerts a long-lasting influence (several minutes or hours) on PFC pyramidal neurons. In contrast, during performance of a cognitive task, the duration of the postsynaptic effect of phasic DA release is short lasting. The functional relationships of these two time scales of DA modulation remain poorly understood. Here we propose a model that combines these two time scales of DA modulation on a prefrontal neural network. The model links the cellular and behavioral levels during performance of the delayed alternation task. The network, which represents the activity of deep-layer pyramidal neurons with intrinsic neuronal properties, exhibits two stable states of activity that can be switched on and off by excitatory inputs from long-distance cortical areas arriving in superficial layers. These stable states allow PFC neurons to maintain representations during the delay period. The role of an increase of DA receptors stimulation is to restrict inputs arriving on the prefrontal network. The model explains how the level of working memory performance follows an inverted U-shape with an increased stimulation of DA D1 receptors. The model predicts that (1) D1 receptor agonists increase perseverations, (2) D1 antagonists increase distractability, and (3) the duration of the postsynaptic effect of phasic DA release in the PFC is adjusted to the delay period of the task. These results show how the precise duration of the postsynaptic effect of phasic DA release influences behavioral performance during a simple cognitive task.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals can predict the time of occurrence of a forthcoming event relative to a preceding stimulus, i.e. the interval time between those two, given previous learning experience with the temporal contingency between them. Accumulating evidence suggests that a particular pattern of neural activity observed during tasks involving fixed temporal intervals might carry interval time information: the activity of some cortical and subcortical neurons ramps up slowly and linearly during the interval, like a temporal integrator, and peaks around the time at which the event is due to occur. The slope of this climbing activity, and hence the peak time, adjusts to the length of a temporal interval during repetitive experience with it. Various neural mechanisms for producing climbing activity with variable slopes, representing the length of learned intervals, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The dopaminergic modulation of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for working memory. Delay-activity in the PFC in working memory tasks persists even if interfering stimuli intervene between the presentation of the sample and the target stimulus. Here, the hypothesis is put forward that the functional role of dopamine in working memory processing is to stabilize active neural representations in the PFC network and thereby to protect goal-related delay-activity against interfering stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we examined the reported dopamine-induced changes in several biophysical properties of PFC neurons to determine whether they could fulfill this function. An attractor network model consisting of model neurons was devised in which the empirically observed effects of dopamine on synaptic and voltage-gated membrane conductances could be represented in a biophysically realistic manner. In the model, the dopamine-induced enhancement of the persistent Na+ and reduction of the slowly inactivating K+ current increased firing of the delay-active neurons, thereby increasing inhibitory feedback and thus reducing activity of the "background" neurons. Furthermore, the dopamine-induced reduction of EPSP sizes and a dendritic Ca2+ current diminished the impact of intervening stimuli on current network activity. In this manner, dopaminergic effects indeed acted to stabilize current delay-activity. Working memory deficits observed after supranormal D1-receptor stimulation could also be explained within this framework. Thus, the model offers a mechanistic explanation for the behavioral deficits observed after blockade or after supranormal stimulation of dopamine receptors in the PFC and, in addition, makes some specific empirical predictions.},

Human subjects classified as "impulsive," for example, those with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, are slower to respond to the stop signal. Although functional and structural imaging studies in humans have implicated frontal and basal ganglia circuitry in the mediation of this form of response control, the precise roles of the cortex and basal ganglia in SSRT performance are far from understood. We describe effects of excitotoxic fiber-sparing lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OF), infralimbic cortex (IL), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) in rats performing a SSRT task. Lesions to the OF slowed SSRT, whereas lesions to the IL or the STN had no effect. On the go-signal trials, neither cortical lesion affected go-trial reaction time (GoRT), but STN lesions speeded such latencies. The STN lesion also significantly reduced accuracy of stopping at all stop-signal delays, indicative of a generalized stopping impairment that was independent of the SSRT itself.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally, dense amnesia in humans has been thought to be caused by damage to memory structures within the medial temporal lobe, either the hippocampus, the perirhinal cortex or a combination of the two. Recent work in animals has indicated that damage to the hippocampus results in memory impairments that are specific to memories for events. In contrast, damage to the perirhinal cortex impairs object memories in primates, which are likely to be analogous to human semantic memory. Discrete damage to either of these structures does not appear to result in severe and global memory impairments. We propose an alternative to this medial temporal lobe explanation of dense amnesia, based on our recent work. We have shown that the cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain are essential for new learning of both object and event-like memories in the monkey. Our model of learning in the primate brain rests on the proposal that there is a route of communication between the frontal cortex and inferior temporal cortex and hippocampus via the basal forebrain, which is critical for memory encoding. Interruption to this circuit at any stage will result in a severe and global anterograde amnesia.},

  Abstract                 = {How the brain decides which information to process 'consciously' has been debated over for decades without a simple explanation at hand. While most experiments manipulate the perceptual energy of presented stimuli, the distractor-induced blindness task is a prototypical paradigm to investigate gating of information into consciousness without or with only minor visual manipulation. In this paradigm, subjects are asked to report intervals of coherent dot motion in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream, whenever these are preceded by a particular color stimulus in a different RSVP stream. If distractors (i.e., intervals of coherent dot motion prior to the color stimulus) are shown, subjects' abilities to perceive and report intervals of target dot motion decrease, particularly with short delays between intervals of target color and target motion. We propose a biologically plausible neuro-computational model of how the brain controls access to consciousness to explain how distractor-induced blindness originates from information processing in the cortex and basal ganglia. The model suggests that conscious perception requires reverberation of activity in cortico-subcortical loops and that basal-ganglia pathways can either allow or inhibit this reverberation. In the distractor-induced blindness paradigm, inadequate distractor-induced response tendencies are suppressed by the inhibitory 'hyperdirect' pathway of the basal ganglia. If a target follows such a distractor closely, temporal aftereffects of distractor suppression prevent target identification. The model reproduces experimental data on how delays between target color and target motion affect the probability of target detection.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study was undertaken to determine in the rat the topography of the neostriatal projections originating from the motor cortex. For that purpose, anterograde tracers (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin: PHA-L; wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase: WGA-HRP) were deposited in discrete cortical sites physiologically identified by microstimulation. Five major motor areas were considered in this study: the rostral (RFL) and caudal (CFL) forelimb areas, the hindlimb (HL) area, the vibrissae motor-frontal eye field (V-FEF) region and the jaw, lips and tongue (JLT) area (according to the nomenclature of Neafsey et al.). The results indicate that functionally different regions of the motor cortex project to different sectors of the caudate putamen (CPU). All 3 distinct limb areas RFL, CFL and HL project to the dorsolateral quarter of the CPU, V-FEF area projects to the dorsomedial quarter, whereas the JLT area projects to the ventrolateral quarter. The pattern of terminal labeling is relatively consistent, whatever the cortical area in which the tracer is deposited. This pattern is characterized by the presence of two or more labeled bands which are obliquely oriented along a ventrolateral-dorsomedial axis. Control experiments were also undertaken in which a retrograde tracer (WGA-HRP) was deposited in various neostriatal loci. The results are congruent with the findings of the anterograde study and further indicate that a given neostriatal sector receives projections from cytoarchitectonically different but functionally related regions of the neocortex. The somatotopic features of both motor and somatosensory corticostriatal projections appear to be in register. In addition, the striatal distribution of motor cortical fibers was compared in 6 experimental cases to the compartmental subdivision of the striatum in patches and matrix, following immunohistochemical localization of calbindin 28 kDa. The calbindin-immunoreactivity is extremely weak in the dorsolateral sector but is higher in the central and ventrolateral parts of the CPU. In these deep striatal regions receiving fibers from V-FEF, JLT and, to a lesser extent, from the limb areas, the cortical fibers are mostly directed to the matrix. The band-like organization of the projection from the motor cortex is correlated to the patch-matrix organization. The patches correspond to the bands of low density of terminal fibers and the matrix to the bands of high terminal density. The present results provide an anatomical basis to both electrophysiological and behavioral observations suggesting that functional distinctions can be established between subregions of the striatum.},

  Abstract                 = {Visual short-term memory in humans and animals is frequently assessed using delayed matching to sample (DMTS) and delayed nonmatching to sample (DNMTS) tasks across variable delay intervals. Although these tasks depend on certain common mechanisms, there are behavioral differences between them, and neuroimaging provides a means of assessing explicitly whether this is underpinned by differences at a neural level. Findings of delay-dependent deficits, after lesions in humans and animals, suggest that the neural implementation of these tasks may also critically depend on the delay interval. In this study we determined whether there were differential neural responses associated with DMTS and DNMTS tasks at two different delay intervals using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Ten healthy volunteers were studied under four test conditions: DMTS and DNMTS at 5 and 15 sec delay. The main effect of DMTS compared with DNMTS across both delay intervals was associated with significant activation in bilateral head of caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex. By contrast, DNMTS compared with DMTS was associated with significant activation in mediodorsal thalamus, bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and left premotor cortex. The main effect of short compared with long delay, across both tasks, was associated with significantly greater activity in occipital and parietal cortices. By contrast, long compared with short delay was associated with significantly greater activity in temporal and ventrolateral frontal cortices. We conclude that DMTS and DNMTS are not equivalent and furthermore that the precise neural implementation of these tasks is a dynamic function of delay interval.},

It aims at simulations of large neural systems with more than 10(4) neurons and 10(7) to 10(9) synapses. NEST is implemented in C++ and can be used on a large range of architectures from single-core laptops over multi-core desktop computers to super-computers with thousands of processor cores. Python (http://www.python.org) is a modern programming language that has recently received considerable attention in Computational Neuroscience. Python is easy to learn and has many extension modules for scientific computing (e.g. http://www.scipy.org). In this contribution we describe PyNEST, the new user interface to NEST. PyNEST combines NEST's efficient simulation kernel with the simplicity and flexibility of Python. Compared to NEST's native simulation language SLI, PyNEST makes it easier to set up simulations, generate stimuli, and analyze simulation results.

  Abstract                 = {Recent lesion studies have implicated the perirhinal cortex in learning that two objects are associated, i.e., visual association learning. In this experiment we tested whether neuronal responses to associated stimuli in perirhinal cortex are altered over the course of learning. Neurons were recorded from monkeys during performance of a visual discrimination task in which a predictor stimulus was followed, after a delay, by a GO or NO-GO choice stimulus. Association learning had two major influences on neuronal responses. First, responses to frequently paired predictor-choice stimuli were more similar to one another than was the case with infrequently paired stimuli. Second, the magnitude of activity during the delay was correlated with the magnitude of responses to both the predictor and choice stimuli. Both of these learning effects were found only for stimulus pairs that had been associated on at least 2 d of training. Early in training, the delay activity was correlated only with the response to the predictor stimuli. Thus, with long-term training, perirhinal neurons tend to link the representations of temporally associated stimuli.},

However, the organization of areas important for learning and memory, such as perirhinal cortex, may be modifiable in adults. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from pairs of neurons in perirhinal cortex of macaques while they viewed multiple complex stimuli. For novel stimuli, neuronal response preferences for pairs of nearby neurons and far-apart neurons were uncorrelated. However, after one day of experience with the stimuli, response preferences of nearby neurons became more similar. We conclude that specific visual experience induces development of clusters of perirhinal neurons with similar stimulus preferences.},

We review data from our studies that have utilized procedures which reveal the various influences of pavlovian stimuli on goal-directed behaviour, namely discriminated approach, pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and conditioned reinforcement, in order to demonstrate their overlapping and also unique neural bases. These fundamental studies are also reviewed in the context of the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying drug-seeking behaviour that is under the control of drug-associated environmental stimuli. The ways in which such drug-seeking behaviour becomes compulsive and habitual, as well as the propensity for relapse to drug-seeking even after long periods of relapse, are discussed in terms of the aberrant learning set in train by the effects of self-administered drugs on plastic processes in limbic cortical-ventral striatal systems.},

These data lead to the prediction that D(1) antagonists will attenuate and D(2) antagonists will potentiate at least some types of learning. The prediction is difficult to test, however, because disruptions in either D(1) or D(2) transmission lead to reduced locomotion, exploration, and response execution and are therefore likely to impair learning that requires behavioral responding (including exploration of an environment) during the learning episode. Under a paradigm that minimizes motor requirements, rats were trained to enter a food compartment during pellet presentation. Animals then received tone-food pairings under the influence of D(1) antagonist SCH23390 (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 0.16 mg/kg) or D(2) antagonist raclopride (0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg). An additional group received unpaired presentations of tone and food. On a drug-free test day 24 hr later, animals that had been under the influence of SCH23390 (like animals that had received unpaired presentations of tone and food) showed reduced head entries in response to the tone, whereas animals that had been under the influence of raclopride showed increased head entries in response to the tone compared with vehicle controls. These data demonstrate that, under a conditioned approach paradigm, D(1) and D(2) family receptor antagonists disrupt and promote learning, respectively, as predicted by the effects of D(1) and D(2) receptor blockade on neuronal plasticity.},

In the present experiment, the effects of lesions of the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum were investigated on two tasks that differentially require the development of stimulus-response learning. The first task utilized an operant conditional discrimination task, which is likely to rely heavily upon stimulus-response learning. The second task looked conditioned place preference learning, a task that is unlikely to require the development of stimulus-response associations. Animals with lesions of the dorsolateral striatum were impaired on the operant conditional discrimination task, but retained the ability to learn the conditioned place preference task. In contrast, animals with lesions of the dorsomedial striatum were not found to be impaired on either task used in the present experiment. These results suggest that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for the successful acquisition of tasks that place a demand upon stimulus-response learning, while the dorsomedial striatum is not involved in this type of learning.},

The detection limit for DA was 0.03-0.1 pg/5 microl injection using a conventional HPLC set-up. Basal levels in PFC were at the detection limit, therefore 3 microM nomifensine was included in the Ringer perfusion fluid, producing readily detectable DA levels of 0.9 pg/injection. Perfusion with 3 microM TTX for 30 min decreased DA within 11 min to 10\% of control. The routine use of rapid sampling of extracellular DA was applied to study cortical DA release in relation to behaviour. Exposure to a novel environment for 5.5 min led to an increase to 135\%. Presentation of a food pellet to food-deprived rats resulted in a rapid increase to 150\% within 5.5 min, which lasted 30-40 min, which is 10-20 min more than the time spent eating. Handling the rat for 5.5 min increased DA in PFC within 5.5 min to 160\% and in 11 min to 190\% of control followed by a 25-min period of a 50\% increase, probably reflecting increased arousal. The results suggest that emotional arousal is a common denominator of increased cortical DA release and that responses are graded depending on the intensity of the stimulus.},

When determined one day after cannula placement, noradrenaline and dopamine levels were higher during the dark. Maximal relative increases induced by novelty and handling were 150\% and 175-200\%, respectively, and were very similar in the light and the dark, but the net increases were higher in the dark. Separate groups were tested one week after cannula placement to ensure recovery of possibly disturbed circadian rhythms. While basal levels in the dark were now approximately twice those in the light, the maximal relative and net increases after both novelty and handling were very similar. Basal levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (one day after cannula placement) were not different in the light or dark, but were increased by novelty and handling to about 130\% only in the light period, not in the dark. Thus, in the prefrontal cortex, dopamine strongly resembles noradrenaline, in that basal efflux was state dependent, whereas activation by stimuli was not. In the nucleus accumbens, basal dopamine efflux was not state dependent, but activation by stimuli was. These results suggest that there are differential effects of circadian phase on basal activity and responsiveness of the mesolimbic vs the mesocortical dopamine system.},

Furthermore, where such simulations are used in an embodied setting, the simulation must be real-time in order to be useful. In this paper we present NeMo, a platform for such simulations which achieves high performance through the use of highly parallel commodity hardware in the form of graphics processing units (GPUs). NeMo makes use of the Izhikevich neuron model which provides a range of realistic spiking dynamics while being computationally efficient. Our GPU kernel can deliver up to 400 million spikes per second. This corresponds to a real-time simulation of around 40 000 neurons under biologically plausible conditions with 1000 synapses per neuron and a mean firing rate of 10 Hz.},

  Abstract                 = {Corticostriatal projections originate from the entire cerebral cortex and provide the major source of glutamatergic inputs to the basal ganglia. Despite the importance of corticostriatal connections in sensorimotor learning and cognitive functions, plasticity forms at these synapses remain strongly debated. Using a corticostriatal slice preserving the connections between the somatosensory cortex and the target striatal cells, we report the induction of both non-Hebbian and Hebbian forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) on striatal output neurons (SONs). LTP and LTD can be induced selectively by different stimulation patterns (high-frequency trains vs low-frequency pulses) and were evoked with similar efficiency in non-Hebbian and Hebbian modes. Combination of LTP-LTD and LTD-LTP sequences revealed that bidirectional plasticity occurs at the same SONs and provides efficient homeostatic mechanisms leading to a resetting of corticostriatal synapses avoiding synaptic saturation. The effect of temporal relationship between cortical stimulation and SON activity was assessed using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols. An LTP was observed when an action potential was triggered in the striatal neuron before the cortical stimulus, and, conversely, an LTD was induced when the striatal neuron discharge was triggered after the cortical stimulation. Such STDP was reversed when compared with those described so far in other mammalian brain structures. This mechanism may be essential for the role of the striatum in learning of motor sequences in which sensory and motor events are associated in a precise time sequence.},

  Abstract                 = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated when reward is greater than predicted, and this error signal could teach target neurons both the value of reward and when it will occur. We used the dopamine error signal to measure how the expectation of reward was distributed over time. Animals were trained with fixed-duration intervals of 1-16 s between conditioned stimulus onset and reward. In contrast to the weak responses that have been observed after short intervals (1-2 s), activations to reward increased steeply and linearly with the logarithm of the interval. Results with varied stimulus-reward intervals suggest that the neural expectation was substantial after just half an interval had elapsed. Thus, the neural expectation of reward in these experiments was not highly precise and the precision declined sharply with interval duration. The neural precision of expectation appeared to be at least qualitatively similar to the precision of anticipatory licking behavior.},

It is determined by probability P, being maximal at P = 0.5 and decreasing at higher and lower probabilities. Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The basal ganglia receive massive inputs from the neocortex and send outputs that exert both inhibitory and disinhibitory control over parts of the frontal cortex and brainstem. Between these basal ganglia inputs and outputs lies the striatum, which receives most of the cortical afferents and projects to the basal ganglia output nuclei--the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. To analyze this system we conjointly labeled, in squirrel monkeys, sensorimotor cortical inputs to the striatum and striatal outputs to the globus pallidus. Anterograde tracers were injected into the motor (MI) and somatosensory (SI) cortical body maps, at sites determined by electrophysiological stimulation and recording. Retrograde tracers were stereotaxically injected into the external and internal pallidal segments (GPe and GPi). We found that multiple dispersed modules ("matrisomes") in the putamen that all received inputs from single body-part representations in sensorimotor cortex could, in turn, send convergent outputs to single sites in the pallidum. This divergence-reconvergence pattern was found for both GPe and GPi sites, and for inputs from both SI and MI cortex. Thus, information from a single functional region in the cortex can be split up at the striatal stage only to be brought back together in the pallidum. The temporary divergence may increase lateral interactions between sensorimotor matrisomes, as well as between matrisomes and striosomes. One function of striatal modularity may thus be to set up an associative network in the striatum, which might contribute to sensorimotor learning. We also found that some sets of matrisomes did not receive strong sensorimotor inputs, even though they projected to regions of GPe and GPi that are near the sensorimotor-recipient zones described above. Thus, the matrisomal system may sort MI/SI inputs and other inputs before transfer to paired regions of GPe and GPi.},

In the context of motor function, these interconnections can be understood as disinhibiting, or "releasing the brakes," on frontal motor action plans: The basal ganglia detect appropriate contexts for performing motor actions and enable the frontal cortex to execute such actions at the appropriate time. We build on this idea in the domain of working memory through the use of computational neural network models of this circuit. In our model, the frontal cortex exhibits robust active maintenance, whereas the basal ganglia contribute a selective, dynamic gating function that enables frontal memory representations to be rapidly updated in a task-relevant manner. We apply the model to a novel version of the continuous performance task that requires subroutine-like selective working memory updating and compare and contrast our model with other existing models and theories of frontal-cortex-basal-ganglia interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for action, perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

  Abstract                 = {The dopamine system plays a major role in responses to potentially rewarding stimuli. An important input to the dopamine neurons is derived from the central nucleus of the amygdala. The central nucleus is a complex structure consisting of several subdivisions with distinct histochemical, morphologic, and connectional features. The central nucleus subdivisions are therefore likely to have specific inputs to the dopamine neurons. The midbrain dopamine cells are divided into dorsal and ventral subpopulations. We determined the organization of inputs from the central nucleus subdivisions to the dopamine subpopulations in monkeys. The dorsal tier neurons receive relatively greater central nucleus input compared to the ventral tier. Within the ventral tier, the central nucleus projects to the densocellular region, but not the cell columns. Furthermore, the midbrain subpopulations receive a differential projection from specific central nucleus subterritories. The medial subdivision of the central nucleus has the greatest input to the dopamine system, and projects throughout the dorsal tier and densocellular regions. This indicates that the medial subdivision influences not only the ventral striatum but also more dorsal striatal areas, through its inputs to these dopamine subpopulations. In contrast, the capsular subdivision of the lateral central nucleus and the amygdalostriatal area project preferentially to the dorsal tier, which selectively modulates the ventral striatum and cortex. The central core of the lateral central nucleus is unique in its restricted projection to the lateral substantia nigra in the region of the nigrotectal pathway. Taken as a whole, the central nucleus-nigral pathway provides a route for affectively significant stimuli to modulate the DA system, influencing the initiation of behavioral responses.},

We report here recordings from prefrontal neurons in rhesus monkeys trained to perform a delayed anti-saccade task based on tests that have been used with humans. Activity in the same prefrontal neurons was recorded across conditions when saccades were made toward a remembered target, and also when this prepotent response was suppressed and a saccade in the opposite direction required. Our findings show that most prefrontal neurons code the location of the visual stimulus in working memory, and that this memory can be engaged to suppress as well as prescribe a response. These results establish, in a subset of prefrontal neurons, the iconic nature of the memory code, and suggest a role for visual memory in response suppression.},

  Abstract                 = {The parahippocampal region in the rodent brain includes the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices, the presubiculum, and the parasubiculum. In recent years, the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices have been a focus in memory research because they supply highly processed, polymodal sensory information to the hippocampus, both directly and via the entorhinal cortex. Available evidence indicates that these cortices receive different complements of cortical information, which are then forwarded to the hippocampus via parallel pathways.Here we have summarized the cortical, subcortical, and hippocampal connections of the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices in order to provide further insight into the nature of the information that is processed by these regions prior to arriving in the hippocampus. As has been previously described, the cortical afferents of the rodent postrhinal cortex are dominated by structures known to be involved in the processing of visual and spatial information, whereas the cortical afferents of the perirhinal cortex result in remarkable convergence of polymodal sensory information. The two regions are also differentiated by their cortical efferents. The perirhinal cortex projects more strongly to piriform, frontal, and insular regions, whereas the postrhinal cortex projects preferentially to visual and visuospatial regions. The subcortical connections of the two regions provide further evidence that they have different functions. For example, the perirhinal cortex has strong reciprocal connections with the amygdala, which suggest involvement in processing affective stimuli. Subcortical input to the postrhinal cortex is dominated by projections from dorsal thalamic structures, particularly the lateral posterior nucleus. Although the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices are considered to contribute to the episodic memory system, many questions remain about their particular roles. A detailed description of the anatomical connections of the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices will permit the generation of new, anatomically guided, hypotheses about their role in episodic memory and other cognitive processes.

  Abstract                 = {Monkeys were trained to perform a visual short-term memory task (delayed matching to sample). In some of the animals, cooling probes were implanted over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, covering sulcus principalis and adjacent areas; microelectrode pedestals were implanted over inferotemporal cortex. Other animals were fitted with converse implants: cooling probes over a portion of the inferotemporal cortical convexity and microelectrode pedestals over prefrontal cortex. In the awake and behaving monkeys, bilateral cooling of either the prefrontal or the inferotemporal region (to 20 degrees C) induced, in the other region, reversible changes of spontaneous and task-related cell discharge. In the two cortices remote cooling induced augmentations and diminutions of cell reaction to the color samples which the animal had to retain for correct performance of the task. The same was true for cell discharge during the delay, the retention period which followed each sample. However, a net effect of remote cooling was, in both cortices, a diminution of color-dependent differences in the reactions and delay-discharge of some cells. Concomitantly, errors of task-performance increased. Cells that as a result of remote cortical cooling showed changes of reaction to the color samples were found more commonly in supragranular than infragranular layers. The results are interpreted as evidence of mutual influences between inferotemporal and prefrontal areas, probably mediated by corticocortical connections. The single-cell data, together with the behavioral data, suggest that those influences are functionally important for visual discrimination and short-term memory.},

Second, remembered intervals and rates translate into observed behavior through decision processes whose structure is adapted to noise in the decision variables. The noise and the uncertainties consequent on it have both subjective and objective origins. A third feature of these models is their timescale invariance, which the authors argue is a very important property evident in the available experimental data. This conceptual framework is similar to the psychophysical conceptual framework in which contemporary models of sensory processing are rooted. The authors contrast it with the associative conceptual framework.},

  Abstract                 = {The present series of experiments aimed to pinpoint the source of nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) effects on delay discounting. Rats were trained with an impulsive choice procedure between an adjusting smaller sooner reward and a fixed larger later reward. The AcbC-lesioned rats produced appropriate choice behavior when the reward magnitude was equal. An increase in reward magnitude resulted in a failure to increase preference for the larger later reward in the AcbC-lesioned rats, whereas a decrease in the larger later reward duration resulted in normal alterations in choice behavior in AcbC-lesioned rats. Subsequent experiments with a peak timing (Experiments 2 and 3) and a behavioral contrast (Experiment 4) indicated that the AcbC-lesioned rats suffered from decreased incentive motivation during changes in reward magnitude (Experiments 2 and 4) and when expected rewards were omitted (Experiments 2 and 3), but displayed intact anticipatory timing of reward delays (Experiments 2 and 3). The results indicate that the nucleus accumbens core is critical for determining the incentive value of rewards, but does not participate in the timing of reward delays.},

Increases in reinforcer magnitude produced a leftward shift in the peak that persisted for 20 sessions of training. In a final phase, the rats received lithium chloride-induced aversion prior to testing and a rightward shift in the peak was observed. Experiment 2 confirmed the rightward shift in the peak under lithium chloride devaluation and induced a comparable shift with satiety devaluation. The degree of rightward shift was neither additive nor multiplicative, suggesting that two processes may have contributed. Experiment 3 examined the effect of extinction on peak responding, revealing a decrease in response rate, but no evidence of any change in the timing of responding. The implications of the results for contemporary timing theories are discussed.},

The present paper reviews several recent studies, as well as presenting some new evidence with further manipulations of reward value during training vs. testing on a peak procedure. The combined results cannot be accounted for by any of the current psychological timing theories. However, in examining the neural circuitry of the reward system, it is not surprising that motivation has an impact on timing because the motivation/valuation system directly interfaces with the timing system. A new approach is proposed for the development of the next generation of timing models, which utilizes knowledge of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the reward system to guide the development of a neurocomputational model of the reward system. The initial foundation along with heuristics for proceeding with developing such a model is unveiled in an attempt to stimulate new theoretical approaches in the field.},

These dual thalamostriatal systems display striking differences in their anatomical and, most likely, functional organization. The CM/PF-striatal system is topographically organized, and integrated within functionally segregated basal ganglia-thalamostriatal circuits that process sensorimotor, associative and limbic information. CM/PF neurons are highly responsive to attention-related sensory stimuli, suggesting that the CM/PF-striatal system, through its strong connections with cholinergic interneurons, may play a role in basal ganglia-mediated learning, behavioral switching and reinforcement. In light of evidence for prominent CM/PF neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease, we propose that the significant CM-striatal system degeneration, combined with the severe nigrostriatal dopamine loss in sensorimotor striatal regions, may alter normal automatic actions, and shift the processing of basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor programs towards goal-directed behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {The prefrontal cortex plays a fundamental role in the working memory functions of the cerebral cortex and is also the site of dysfunction in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Prefrontal neurons are distinguished by their capacity for sustained activity during the time a stimulus is held in memory, and this mnemonic response is considered a substrate for a variety of cognitive functions. The neuronal basis for sustained activity in prefrontal neurons is unknown but is thought to involve recurrent excitation among pyramidal neurons. Recent studies in awake behaving monkeys have demonstrated that the persistent activity in prefrontal neurons is modulated by dopamine. To examine the mechanisms by which dopamine might modulate transmission in local excitatory circuits, we have performed dual whole-cell recordings in connected pyramidal cell pairs with and without dopamine application. We find that dopamine reduces the efficacy of unitary excitatory neurotransmission in layer V pyramidal cells by decreasing its reliability. These effects, which are reproduced by a selective D1 agonist and blocked by a D1 antagonist, are independent of voltage changes and are not attenuated by blockade of sodium and potassium channels in the postsynaptic neurons. We conclude that attenuation of local horizontal excitatory synaptic transmission in layer V pyramidal neurons by dopamine is through D1 actions at a presynaptic site.},

We found that dopamine depressed inhibitory transmission between FS interneurons and pyramidal neurons but enhanced inhibition between non-FS interneurons and pyramidal cells. FS inhibitory transmission exhibited properties associated with presynaptic action at D(1) receptors that were not evident in non-FS inhibitory connections. In addition, FS and non-FS interneurons differed morphologically, forming contacts on the perisomatic and peridendritic domains, respectively, of their pyramidal cell targets. These findings provide evidence for both a dual mode of inhibition in prefrontal circuitry and circuit-dependent modulation by dopamine.},

However, the afferent system of the VTA comprises very abundant neurons within a large formation extending from the prefrontal cortex to the caudal brainstem. Neurons in nearly all parts of this continuum may be glutamatergic and equivalently important to VTA function. Thus, we sought to identify the full range of glutamatergic inputs to the VTA by combining retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-bound gold after injections into the VTA with nonisotopic in situ hybridization of the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1, 2, and 3. We found glutamatergic neurons innervating the VTA in almost all structures projecting there and that a majority of these are subcortical and VGLUT2 mRNA positive. The tremendous convergence of glutamatergic afferents from many brain areas in the VTA suggests that (1) the function of the VTA requires integration of manifold and diverse bits of information and (2) the activity of the VTA reflects the ongoing activities of various combinations of its afferents.},

  Abstract                 = {Glutamatergic afferents of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play an important role in the functioning of the VTA and are involved in the pathophysiology of drug addiction. It has recently been demonstrated that the VTA is densely innervated by glutamatergic axons and that glutamatergic neurons projecting to the VTA are situated in almost all structures that project there. While the projection from the prefrontal cortex is essentially entirely glutamatergic, subcortical glutamatergic neurons innervating the VTA intermingle with non-glutamatergic, most likely GABAergic and/or peptidergic VTA-projecting neurons. The first part of this review focuses on the origins and putative functional implications of various glutamatergic projections to the VTA. In the second part we consider how different neuropeptides via different mechanisms modulate glutamatergic actions in the VTA. We conclude by developing a model of how the glutamatergic afferents might together contribute to the functions of the VTA.},

  Abstract                 = {The striatum, which is the major component of the basal ganglia in the brain, is regulated in part by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. Severe movement disorders result from the loss of striatal dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease. Rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a model for Parkinson's disease and show alterations in gene expression in the two major output systems of the striatum to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Striatopallidal neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced elevation in their specific expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the D2 dopamine receptor and enkephalin, which is reversed by subsequent continuous treatment with the D2 agonist quinpirole. Conversely, striatonigral neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced reduction in their specific expression of mRNAs encoding the D1 dopamine receptor and substance P, which is reversed by subsequent daily injections of the D1 agonist SKF-38393. This treatment also increases dynorphin mRNA in striatonigral neurons. Thus, the differential effects of dopamine on striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons are mediated by their specific expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {A paradox that exists in auditory and electrosensory neural systems is that they encode behaviorally relevant signals in the range of a few microseconds with neurons that are at least one order of magnitude slower. The importance of temporal coding in neural information processing is not clear yet. A central question is whether neuronal firing can be more precise than the time constants of the neuronal processes involved. Here we address this problem using the auditory system of the barn owl as an example. We present a modelling study based on computer simulations of a neuron in the laminar nucleus. Three observations explain the paradox. First, spiking of an 'integrate-and-fire' neuron driven by excitatory postsynaptic potentials with a width at half-maximum height of 250 micros, has an accuracy of 25 micros if the presynaptic signals arrive coherently. Second, the necessary degree of coherence in the signal arrival times can be attained during ontogenetic development by virtue of an unsupervised hebbian learning rule. Learning selects connections with matching delays from a broad distribution of axons with random delays. Third, the learning rule also selects the correct delays from two independent groups of inputs, for example, from the left and right ear.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well established that various cortical regions can implement a wide array of neural processes, yet the mechanisms which integrate these processes into behavior-producing, brain-scale activity remain elusive. We propose that an important role in this respect might be played by executive structures controlling the traffic of information between the cortical regions involved. To illustrate this hypothesis, we present a neural network model comprising a set of interconnected structures harboring stimulus-related activity (visual representation, working memory, and planning), and a group of executive units with task-related activity patterns that manage the information flowing between them. The resulting dynamics allows the network to perform the dual task of either retaining an image during a delay (delayed-matching to sample task), or recalling from this image another one that has been associated with it during training (delayed-pair association task). The model reproduces behavioral and electrophysiological data gathered on the inferior temporal and prefrontal cortices of primates performing these same tasks. It also makes predictions on how neural activity coding for the recall of the image associated with the sample emerges and becomes prospective during the training phase. The network dynamics proves to be very stable against perturbations, and it exhibits signs of scale-invariant organization and cooperativity. The present network represents a possible neural implementation for active, top-down, prospective memory retrieval in primates. The model suggests that brain activity leading to performance of cognitive tasks might be organized in modular fashion, simple neural functions becoming integrated into more complex behavior by executive structures harbored in prefrontal cortex and/or basal ganglia.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter reviews recent evidence establishing the comparable organization of dopamine afferents and dopaminergic receptors in the human and monkey prefrontal cortex. Light microscopy using a dopamine-specific antibody reveals that the dopamine innervation in the human prefrontal cortex exhibits a distinct bilaminar distribution with dense bands of fibers in the upper and deeper strata of the cortex, closely resembling the patterning of dopamine fibers in the monkey prefrontal cortex. Also, EM-immunohistochemistry has now revealed identical synaptic complexes both in human and monkey. In both species, dopamine axons from symmetric synapses predominantly on the spines of pyramidal cells. In many cases, the same spine is apposed by an asymmetric, putatively excitatory synapse. Finally, both in human and monkey prefrontal cortex, the dopamine D1-specific ligand, 3H-SCH23390, and the D2-specific ligand, H3-raclopride, label binding sites in laminar positions which match the location of the densest dopamine innervation. These results indicate that the organization of the cortical dopamine system is essentially the same in macaque monkey and human and that the nonhuman primate is a suitable animal model for analysis of dopamine function in prefrontal cortex.},

It is an intuitive and highly flexible tool for rapidly developing new models, especially networks of single-compartment neurons. In addition to using standard types of neuron models, users can define models by writing arbitrary differential equations in ordinary mathematical notation. Python scientific libraries can also be used for defining models and analysing data. Vectorisation techniques allow efficient simulations despite the overheads of an interpreted language. Brian will be especially valuable for working on non-standard neuron models not easily covered by existing software, and as an alternative to using Matlab or C for simulations. With its easy and intuitive syntax, Brian is also very well suited for teaching computational neuroscience.},

  Abstract                 = {Prefrontal cortical dopamine (DA) modulates pyramidal cell excitability directly and indirectly by way of its actions on local circuit GABAergic interneurons. DA modulation of interneuronal functions is implicated in the computational properties of prefrontal networks during cognitive processes and in schizophrenia. Morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct classes of putative GABAergic interneurons are found in layers II-V of rat prefrontal cortex. Our whole cell patch-clamp study shows that DA induced a direct, TTX-insensitive, reversible membrane depolarization, and increased the excitability of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons. The DA-induced membrane depolarization was reduced significantly by D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, but not by the D2 receptor antagonist (-)sulpiride, D4 receptor antagonists U101958 or L-745870, alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, or serotoninergic receptor antagonist mianserin. The D1/5 agonists SKF81297 or dihydrexidine, but not D2 agonist quinpirole, also induced a prolonged membrane depolarization. Voltage-clamp analyses of the voltage-dependence of DA-sensitive currents, and the effects of changing [K(+)](O) on reversal potentials of DA responses, revealed that DA suppressed a Cs(+)-sensitive inward rectifier K(+) current and a resting leak K(+) current. D1/D5, but not D2 agonists mimicked the suppressive effects of DA on the leak current, but the DA effects on the inward rectifier K(+) current were not mimicked by either agonist. In a subgroup of FS interneurons, the slowly inactivating membrane outward rectification evoked by depolarizing voltage steps was also attenuated by DA. Collectively, these data showed that DA depolarizes FS interneurons by suppressing a voltage-independent 'leak' K(+) current (via D1/D5 receptor mechanism) and an inwardly rectifying K(+) current (via unknown DA mechanisms). Additional suppression of a slowly inactivating K(+) current led to increase in repetitive firing in response to depolarizing inputs. This D1-induced increase in interneuron excitability enhances GABAergic transmission to PFC pyramidal neurons and could represent a mechanism via which DA suppresses persistent firing of pyramidal neurons in vivo.},

Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings simultaneously with DA system manipulation in rats, we show that tonic and phasic DA release selectively modulates hippocampal and prefrontal cortical inputs through D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. In addition, we also found that D1 activation and D2 inactivation in the NAcc produced behaviorally selective effects (learning versus set shifting of response strategy) that correspond to specific afferents. These results suggest that the dynamics of DA release regulate the balance between limbic and cortical drive through activation and inactivation of DA receptor subtypes in the accumbens, and this regulates goal-directed behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic structure connected with both the basal ganglia and the limbic system and that exerts a major influence on midbrain monoaminergic nuclei. The current view is that LHb receives and processes cortical information in order to select proper strategies in a variety of behavior. Recent evidence indicates that LHb might also be implicated in hippocampus-dependent memory processes. However, if and how LHb functionally interacts with the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) is still unknown. We therefore performed simultaneous recordings within LHb and dHPC in both anesthetized and freely moving rats. We first showed that a subset of LHb cells were phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations. Furthermore, LHb generated spontaneous theta oscillatory activity, which was highly coherent with hippocampal theta oscillations. Using reversible LHb inactivation, we found that LHb might regulate dHPC theta oscillations. In addition, we showed that LHb silencing altered performance in a hippocampus-dependent spatial recognition task. Finally, increased coherence between LHb and dHPC was positively correlated to the memory performance in this test. Collectively, these results suggest that LHb functionally interacts with the hippocampus and is involved in hippocampus-dependent spatial information processing.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 26 June 2013; doi:10.1038/npp.2013.142.},

Attractor networks in VMPFC area 10 then implement categorical decision processes that transform value signals into a choice between the values, thereby guiding action.

  Abstract                 = {A novel mechanism for regulating dopamine activity in subcortical sites and its possible relevance to schizophrenia is proposed. This hypothesis is based on the regulation of dopamine release into subcortical regions occurring via two independent mechanisms: (1) transient or phasic dopamine release caused by dopamine neuron firing, and (2) sustained, "background" tonic dopamine release regulated by prefrontal cortical afferents. Behaviorally relevant stimuli are proposed to cause short-term activation of dopamine cell firing to trigger the phasic component of dopamine release. In contrast, tonic dopamine release is proposed to regulate the intensity of the phasic dopamine response through its effect on extracellular dopamine levels. In this way, tonic dopamine release would set the background level of dopamine receptor stimulation (both autoreceptor and postsynaptic) and, through homeostatic mechanisms, the responsivity of the system to dopamine in these sites. In schizophrenics, a prolonged decrease in prefrontal cortical activity is proposed to reduce tonic dopamine release. Over time, this would elicit homeostatic compensations that would increase overall dopamine responsivity and thereby cause subsequent phasic dopamine release to elicit abnormally large responses.},

Consistent with the results of previous lesion studies, reversible inactivation of amygdala central nucleus function during pairings of an auditory CS with food prevented the acquisition of conditioned orienting responses specific to auditory CSs, whereas food-related conditioned behaviors were acquired normally. Neither inactivation nor posttraining neurotoxic lesions of the central nucleus affected the expression of previously acquired conditioned orienting. Thus, although the central nucleus is critical to the acquisition of information required for conditioned orienting to auditory cues, it is not needed for maintaining this information for later use.},

  Abstract                 = {A neural network model that controls behavioral timing is described and simulated. This model, called the Spectral Timing Model, controls a type of timing whereby an animal or robot can learn to wait for an expected goal by discounting expected nonoccurrences of a goal object until the expected time of arrival of the goal. If the goal object does not then materialize, the animal can respond to unexpected nonoccurrences of the goal with appropriate changes in information processing and exploratory behavior. The model is a variant of the gated dipole model of opponent processing. When the gated dipole model is generalized to include a spectrum of cellular response rates within a large population of cells, the model's total output signal generates accurate learned timing properties that collectively provide a good quantitative fit to animal learning data. In particular, the Spectral Timing Model utilizes the habituative transmitter gates and adaptive long-term memory traces that are characteristic of gated dipole models. The Spectral Timing Model is embedded into an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural architecture for the learning of correlations between internal representations of recognition codes and reinforcement codes. This type of learning is called conditioned reinforcer learning. The two types of internal representations are called sensory representations (S) and drive representations (D). Activation of a drive representation D by the Spectral Timing Model inhibits output signals from the orienting subsystem (A) of the ART architecture and activates a motor response. The inhibitory pathway helps to prevent spurious resets of short-term memory, forgetting, and orienting responses from being caused by events other than the goal object prior to the expected arrival time of the goal. Simulated data properties include the inverted U in learning as a function of the interstimulus interval (ISI) that occurs between onset of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US); correlations of peak time, standard deviation, Weber fraction, and peak amplitude of the conditioned response as a function of the ISI; increase of conditioned response amplitude, but not its timing, with US intensity; speed-up of the timing circuit by an increase in CS intensity or by drugs that increase concentrations of brain dopamine or acetylcholine; multiple timing peaks in response to learning conditions using multiple ISIs; and conditioned timing of cell activation within the hippocampus and of the contingent negative variation (CNV) event-related potential. The results on speed-up by drugs that increase brain concentrations of dopamine and acetylcholine support a 1972 prediction that the gated dipole habituative transmitter is a catecholamine and its long-term memory trace transmitter is acetylcholine. It is noted that the timing circuit described herein is only one of several functionally distinct neural circuits for governing different types of timed behavior competence.},

  Abstract                 = {The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are deeply implicated in working memory. Both structures are subject to dopaminergic neuromodulation in a way that exerts a critical influence on the proper operation of working memory. We present a novel network model to elucidate the role of phasic dopamine in the interaction of these two structures in initiating and maintaining mnemonic activity. We argue that neuromodulation plays a critical role in protecting memories against both internal and external sources of noise. Increases in cortical gain engendered by prefrontal dopamine release help make memories robust against external distraction, but do not offer protection against internal noise accompanying recurrent cortical activity. Rather, the output of the basal ganglia provides the gating function of stabilization against noise and distraction by enhancing select memories through targeted disinhibition of cortex. Dopamine in the basal ganglia effectively locks this gate by influencing the stability of up and down states in the striatum. Dopamine's involvement in affective processing endows this gating with specificity to motivational salience. We model a spatial working memory task and show that these combined effects of dopamine lead to superior performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated behavior exhibits properties that change with experience and partially dissociate among a number of brain structures. Here, we review evidence from rodent experiments demonstrating that multiple brain systems acquire information in parallel and either cooperate or compete for behavioral control. We propose a conceptual model of systems interaction wherein a ventral emotional memory network involving ventral striatum (VS), amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex triages behavioral responding to stimuli according to their associated affective outcomes. This system engages autonomic and postural responding (avoiding, ignoring, approaching) in accordance with associated stimulus valence (negative, neutral, positive), but does not engage particular operant responses. Rather, this emotional system suppresses or invigorates actions that are selected through competition between goal-directed control involving dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and habitual control involving dorsolateral striatum (DLS). The hippocampus provides contextual specificity to the emotional system, and provides an information rich input to the goal-directed system for navigation and discriminations involving ambiguous contexts, complex sensory configurations, or temporal ordering. The rapid acquisition and high capacity for episodic associations in the emotional system may unburden the more complex goal-directed system and reduce interference in the habit system from processing contingencies of neutral stimuli. Interactions among these systems likely involve inhibitory mechanisms and neuromodulation in the striatum to form a dominant response strategy. Innate traits, training methods, and task demands contribute to the nature of these interactions, which can include incidental learning in non-dominant systems. Addition of these features to reinforcement learning models of decision-making may better align theoretical predictions with behavioral and neural correlates in animals.},

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Motor-control models of basal ganglia function have emphasized disinhibition through reduction of tonic, inhibitory output. Although these models have shed important light on basal ganglia operations, evidence emerging from electrophysiological studies of behaving primates suggests that disinhibition alone may not adequately explain the role of the basal ganglia in movement. To assess this role in the rat, the most frequently used subject in studies of basal ganglia function, we recorded neuronal activity in the primary output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, during an operant task. After rats were trained to nosepoke into an illuminated hole for access to a 10\% sucrose solution delivered through a spout, single- and multiple-unit activity was recorded during 60-120 nosepoke trials. Compared to the period 60 s before the start of the first trial in the task, 110 of 225 reticulata units increased firing >200\% while 17 of 225 decreased to 40\% of baseline. Of these 225 units, >60\% responded coincident with specific task events such as nosepokes and spout licking. Most nosepoke-responsive units showed either excitation (>50\%) or a combination of excitation and inhibition (>25\%) rather than inhibition alone (>20\%). Increases in firing were also common during approach and licking at the spout, with inhibitions alone comprising 30\% of responses. In some units, there was evidence of reward-related responding, with changes occurring in anticipation of reward delivery or during the delivery of sucrose, but not the persistent licking that continued for several seconds after its offset. While 70\% of units responded during both nosepokes and spout licking, changes in firing were typically unique depending on the motor behavior required (i.e. nosepoking vs. licking).Our results, which indicate a prominent role for increases in nigra reticulata activity during movement, add to growing evidence that although inhibitions may allow desired motor responses to emerge, excitations may help shape behavioral output by suppressing competing motor programs.},

By encoding the propensity for selecting a given action in a scalar value (the salience), it is shown that action selection may be recast in terms of signal selection. The generic properties of signal selection are defined and neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into 'selection' and 'control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its effective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic modulation. The model contrasts with the prevailing functional segregation of basal ganglia into 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways.},

The current paper quantitatively describes the properties of the model using analysis and simulation. The decomposition of the basal ganglia into selection and control pathways is supported in several ways. First, several elegant features are exposed--capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation--which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and biological basal ganglia. Third, the behaviour of the model as a signal selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action selection observed in animals under various levels of dopaminergic modulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cynomolgus monkeys were tested in two computer-controlled visual associative memory tasks. The monkeys chose between visual objects on a screen by touching one. In the configural learning task one correct object and one wrong object were presented in each trial. Each of these two objects was composed of two coloured alphanumeric characters abutted together. The designation of the objects as 'correct' or 'wrong' followed a configural rule: e.g. if AB and CD are correct objects then AD and CB are wrong. In the paired association learning task in each trial three spatially separate objects (single alphanumeric characters) were presented. The central object was an instruction cue and the designation of the side objects as 'correct' or 'wrong' choices followed a paired association rule: e.g. if A, C and B are presented (C in the centre) then A is correct and B is wrong; however, if A, D and C are presented then C is correct and A is wrong. Disrupting the direct cortico-cortical interaction between the inferior temporal cortex and the prefrontal cortex by uncinate fascicle transection led to a learning deficit in the paired association task but not in the configural task. These results suggest that the uncinate fascicle facilitates visual-visual associative learning only in the specific case where a visual object acts as an instruction cue to guide the conditional choice of another, spatially separate object, and they support the evidence for a specific role of the uncinate fascicle in the learning of conditional tasks with visual instruction cues.},

  Abstract                 = {Lesion studies suggest that the perirhinal cortex plays a role in object recognition memory. To analyze its role, we recorded the activity of single neurons in the perirhinal cortex in a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) performing a delayed matching-to-sample task with up to four intervening stimuli. Certain neurons (40 of 90 analyzed) showed a smaller response to an image when it was shown the second time within a trial (as a match image) than when it had been shown (as a sample image) the first time. A new finding was that the perirhinal cortex neurons were actively reset between trials: when a particular image was shown as a sample on a succeeding trial, the response was much larger than when it had been shown as a match image a short time previously on the previous trial. This resetting between trials appears to reflect the operation of an active working memory process rather than a passive temporal decay in a neuronal response. The results thus provide evidence that the perirhinal cortex plays an active role in visual working memory, perhaps in association with other brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex.},

Although the parallel organization of specific corticostriatal pathways is well documented, mechanisms by which dopamine might integrate information across different cortical/basal ganglia circuits are less well understood. We analyzed a collection of retrograde and anterograde tracing studies to understand how the striatonigrostriatal (SNS) subcircuit directs information flow between ventromedial (limbic), central (associative), and dorsolateral (motor) striatal regions. When viewed as a whole, the ventromedial striatum projects to a wide range of the dopamine cells and receives a relatively small dopamine input. In contrast, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) receives input from a broad expanse of dopamine cells and has a confined input to the substantia nigra (SN). The central striatum (CS) receives input from and projects to a relatively wide range of the SN. The SNS projection from each striatal region contains three substantia nigra components: a dorsal group of nigrostriatal projecting cells, a central region containing both nigrostriatal projecting cells and its reciprocal striatonigral terminal fields, and a ventral region that receives a specific striatonigral projection but does not contain its reciprocal nigrostriatal projection. Examination of results from multiple tracing experiments simultaneously demonstrates an interface between different striatal regions via the midbrain dopamine cells that forms an ascending spiral between regions. The shell influences the core, the core influences the central striatum, and the central striatum influences the dorsolateral striatum. This anatomical arrangement creates a hierarchy of information flow and provides an anatomical basis for the limbic/cognitive/motor interface via the ventral midbrain.},

The anterogradely transported lectin Phaseolus vulgaris-leukoagglutinin (PHA-L) was iontophoretically injected into the PPT in 12 rats. Anterogradely labelled fibers and varicosities were observed in the thalamic nuclei, confirming the findings of our previous retrograde studies (Hallanger et al: J. Comp. Neurol. 262:105-124, '87). In addition, PHA-L-labelled fibers and varicosities suggestive of terminal fields were observed in the anterior, tuberal, and posterior lateral hypothalamic regions, the ventral pallidum in the region of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the dorsal and intermediate lateral septal nuclei, and in the central and medial nuclei of the amygdala. To determine whether these were cholinergic projections, the retrograde tracer WGA-HRP was injected into terminal fields in the hypothalamus, septum, ventral pallidum, and amygdala. Numerous ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in the PPT and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) were retrogradely labelled from the lateral hypothalamus. These cholinergic neurons constituted over 20\% of those retrogradely labelled in the dorsolateral mesopontine tegmentum; the balance consisted of noncholinergic neurons of the central tegmental field, retrorubral field, and cuneiform nucleus. Following placement of WGA-HRP into dorsal and intermediate lateral septal regions, the vast majority (greater than 90\%) of retrogradely labelled neurons were cholinergic neurons of the PPT and LDT, with few noncholinergic retrogradely labelled neurons in the adjacent tegmentum. In contrast, fewer cholinergic neurons were retrogradely labelled following placement of tracer into the nucleus basalis of Meynert or into the central, medial, and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, while numerous noncholinergic neurons of the central tegmental field rostral to the PPT and of the retrorubral field adjacent to the PPT were retrogradely labelled in these cases. These anterograde and retrograde studies demonstrate that cholinergic PPT and LDT neurons provide a substantial proportion of mesopontine tegmental afferents to the hypothalamus and lateral septum, while projections to the nucleus basalis and the amygdala are minimal.},

  Abstract                 = {Attention is known to play a key role in perception, including action selection, object recognition and memory. Despite findings revealing competitive interactions among cell populations, attention remains difficult to explain. The central purpose of this paper is to link up a large number of findings in a single computational approach. Our simulation results suggest that attention can be well explained on a network level involving many areas of the brain. We argue that attention is an emergent phenomenon that arises from reentry and competitive interactions. We hypothesize that guided visual search requires the usage of an object-specific template in prefrontal cortex to sensitize V4 and IT cells whose preferred stimuli match the target template. This induces a feature-specific bias and provides guidance for eye movements. Prior to an eye movement, a spatially organized reentry from occulomotor centers, specifically the movement cells of the frontal eye field, occurs and modulates the gain of V4 and IT cells. The processes involved are elucidated by quantitatively comparing the time course of simulated neural activity with experimental data. Using visual search tasks as an example, we provide clear and empirically testable predictions for the participation of IT, V4 and the frontal eye field in attention. Finally, we explain a possible physiological mechanism that can lead to non-flat search slopes as the result of a slow, parallel discrimination process.},

Pooling over space affects the representation of individual stimuli, and thus its understanding is crucial for attention and ultimately for object recognition. Since attention, in turn, is likely to modify such spatial pooling by changing the competitive weight of individual stimuli, we compare the predictions of sum- and max-pooling methods using a model of attention. Both pooling functions can account for data investigating the competition between a pair of stimuli within a V4 receptive field; however, our model using sum-pooling predicts a different tuning curve. If we present an additional probe stimulus with the pair, sum-pooling predicts a bottom-up bias of attention, whereas the competition for attention using max-pooling is robust against the additional stimulus.},

  Abstract                 = {We will describe a computational model of attention which explains the guidance of spatial attention by feedback within a distributed network. We hypothesize that feedback within the ventral pathway transfers the target template from prefrontal areas into intermediate areas like V4. The oculomotor circuit consisting of FEF, LIP and superior colliculus picks up this distributed activity and provides a continuous spatial reentry signal from premotor cells. In order to test this hypothesis, we simulate two experiments that require a response given a color cue. The first experiment indicates a parallel feature-based enhancement prior to any spatial selection. If two targets are behaviorally relevant, as in the second experiment, experimental findings indicate that subjects split their attention between two locations containing the searched feature. Our simulation results suggest that the split in attention between two foci is a transient effect occurring during competition. We predict that the time after cue presentation determines the state of this competition and ultimately the distribution of attention at different locations. In addition we provide simulation results to explain how reentrant processing through the oculomotor circuit might lead to variations of the time for target detection in visual search.},

We here explore an alternative model of feedback. It is derived from studies of attention and thus, probably more flexible with respect to attentive processing in higher brain areas. According to this model, feedback implements a gain increase of the feedforward signal. We use a dynamic model with presynaptic inhibition and Hebbian learning to simultaneously learn feedforward and feedback weights. The weights converge to localized, oriented, and bandpass filters similar as the ones found in V1. Due to presynaptic inhibition the model predicts the organization of receptive fields within the feedforward pathway, whereas feedback primarily serves to tune early visual processing according to the needs of the task.},

Thus, the results of discrimination learning experiments do not readily differentiate deficits in perception from deficits in learning and memory. Here I describe studies that do dissociate learning and memory from perception and show that perirhinal cortex damage impairs learning and/or memory, but not perception. Reanalysis and reconsideration of other published data call into further question the hypothesis that the monkey perirhinal cortex plays a critical role in visual perception.},

We previously presented PVLV, a biologically inspired Pavlovian learning algorithm accounting for DA activity in terms of two interrelated systems: a primary value (PV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a US (reward) and; a learned value (LV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a CS. Here, we provide a more extensive review of the biological mechanisms supporting phasic DA firing and their relation to the spate of Pavlovian conditioning phenomena and their sensitivity to focal brain lesions. We further extend the model by incorporating a new NV (novelty value) component reflecting the ability of novel stimuli to trigger phasic DA firing, providing "novelty bonuses" which encourages exploratory working memory updating and in turn speeds learning in trace conditioning and other working memory-dependent paradigms. The evolving PVLV model builds upon insights developed in many earlier computational models, especially reinforcement learning models based on the ideas of Sutton and Barto, biological models, and the psychological model developed by Savastano and Miller. The PVLV framework synthesizes these various approaches, overcoming important shortcomings of each by providing a coherent and specific mapping to much of the relevant empirical data at both the micro- and macro-levels, and examines their relevance for higher order cognitive functions.},

This paper reviews recent attempts to deconstruct this homunculus by elucidating the precise computational and neural mechanisms underlying the executive functions of the PFC. The overall approach builds upon existing mechanistic models of the basal ganglia (BG) and frontal systems known to play a critical role in motor control and action selection, where the BG provide a 'Go' versus 'NoGo' modulation of frontal action representations. In our model, the BG modulate working memory representations in prefrontal areas to support more abstract executive functions. We have developed a computational model of this system that is capable of developing human-like performance on working memory and executive control tasks through trial-and-error learning. This learning is based on reinforcement learning mechanisms associated with the midbrain dopaminergic system and its activation via the BG and amygdala.

We outline six key functional demands underlying working memory, and then describe the current state of our computational model of the prefrontal cortex and associated systems in the basal ganglia (BG). The model, called PBWM (prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia working memory model), relies on actively maintained representations in the prefrontal cortex, which are dynamically updated/gated by the basal ganglia. It is capable of developing human-like performance largely on its own by taking advantage of powerful reinforcement learning mechanisms, based on the midbrain dopaminergic system and its activation via the basal ganglia and amygdala. These learning mechanisms enable the model to learn to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner.

  Abstract                 = {Histotechnological breakthroughs in the late 1960s paved the way for anatomical discoveries that led to the concepts of the ventral striatal-pallidal system and the extended amygdala. These two macro-anatomical systems, together with the basal nucleus of Meynert, represent the main components of the new anatomy of the basal forebrain. The concept of the ventral striatal-pallidal system provided the first indication of the existence of parallel cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic-cortical circuits, which in turn led to the theory of segregated cortical-subcortical reentrant circuits as a conceptual framework for the study of neuropsychiatric disorders. The multifarious symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, however, cannot be understood unless the extended amygdala, the basal nucleus of Meynert, and the septal-diagonal band system are also included in such deliberations. All of these systems serve as output channels for activities in the greater limbic lobe, which usually is critically involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. Within the context of the new anatomy of the basal forebrain, structures such as the accumbens, the olfactory tubercle, and the amygdala have lost legitimacy as independent functional-anatomical units at the same time as the major components of the last uncharted territory of the human brain, the substantia innominata, have been identified.},

  Abstract                 = {Many computational models of the basal ganglia (BG) have been proposed over the past twenty-five years. While computational neuroscience models have focused on closely matching the neurobiology of the BG, computational cognitive neuroscience (CCN) models have focused on how the BG can be used to implement cognitive and motor functions. This review article focuses on CCN models of the BG and how they use the neuroanatomy of the BG to account for cognitive and motor functions such as categorization, instrumental conditioning, probabilistic learning, working memory, sequence learning, automaticity, reaching, handwriting, and eye saccades. A total of 19 BG models accounting for one or more of these functions are reviewed and compared. The review concludes with a discussion of the limitations of existing CCN models of the BG and prescriptions for future modeling, including the need for computational models of the BG that can simultaneously account for cognitive and motor functions, and the need for a more complete specification of the role of the BG in behavioral functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) can reduce working memory while improving motor function in Parkinson disease (PD), but findings are variable. One possible explanation for this variability is that the effects of bilateral STN DBS on working memory function depend in part on functional or disease asymmetry. The goal of this study was to determine the relative contributions of unilateral DBS to the effects seen with bilateral DBS. Motor (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III, UPDRS) and working memory function (Spatial Delayed Response, SDR) were measured in 49 PD patients with bilateral STN DBS while stimulators were Both-off, Left-on, Right-on and Both-on in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients were off PD medications overnight. Effects of unilateral DBS were compared to effects of bilateral STN DBS. Mean UPDRS and SDR responses to Left-on vs. Right-on conditions did not differ (p>.20). However, improvement in contralateral UPDRS was greater and SDR performance was more impaired by unilateral DBS in the more affected side of the brain than in the less affected side of the brain (p=.008). The effect of unilateral DBS on the more affected side on contralateral UPDRS and SDR responses was equivalent to that of bilateral DBS. These results suggest that motor and working memory function respond to unilateral STN DBS differentially depending on the asymmetry of motor symptoms.},

  Abstract                 = {Reward information is represented by many subcortical areas and neuron types, which constitute a complex network. Its output is usually mediated by the basal ganglia where behaviors leading to rewards are disinhibited and behaviors leading to no reward are suppressed. Midbrain dopamine neurons modulate these basal ganglia neurons differentially using signals related to reward-prediction error. Recent studies suggest that other types of subcortical neurons assist, instruct, or work in parallel with dopamine neurons. Such reward-related neurons are found in the areas which have been associated with stress, pain, mood, emotion, memory, and arousal. These results suggest that reward needs to be understood in a larger framework of animal behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Expectation of reward motivates our behaviors and influences our decisions. Indeed, neuronal activity in many brain areas is modulated by expected reward. However, it is still unclear where and how the reward-dependent modulation of neuronal activity occurs and how the reward-modulated signal is transformed into motor outputs. Recent studies suggest an important role of the basal ganglia. Sensorimotor/cognitive activities of neurons in the basal ganglia are strongly modulated by expected reward. Through their abundant outputs to the brain stem motor areas and the thalamocortical circuits, the basal ganglia appear capable of producing body movements based on expected reward. A good behavioral measure to test this hypothesis is saccadic eye movement because its brain stem mechanism has been extensively studied. Studies from our laboratory suggest that the basal ganglia play a key role in guiding the gaze to the location where reward is available. Neurons in the caudate nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata are extremely sensitive to the positional difference in expected reward, which leads to a bias in excitability between the superior colliculi such that the saccade to the to-be-rewarded position occurs more quickly. It is suggested that the reward modulation occurs in the caudate where cortical inputs carrying spatial signals and dopaminergic inputs carrying reward-related signals are integrated. These data support a specific form of reinforcement learning theories, but also suggest further refinement of the theory.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The present paper reports complex neural activities in the monkey caudate nucleus that precede and anticipate visual stimuli and reward in learned visuomotor paradigms. These activities were revealed typically in the delayed saccade task in which memory and anticipation were required. We classified these activities according to their relationships to the task. 2. Activity related to expectation of a cue (n = 46) preceded the presentation of a spot of light (target cue) that signified the future location of saccade target. When the target cue was delayed, the activity was prolonged accordingly. The same spot of light was preceded by no activity if it acted as a distracting stimulus. 3. The sustained activity (n = 80) was a tonic discharge starting after the target cue as if holding the spatial information. 4. The activity related to expectation of target (n = 109) preceded the appearance of the target whose location was cued previously. It started with or after a saccade to the cued target location and ended with the appearance of the target. The activity was greater when the target was expected to appear in the contralateral visual field. 5. The activity related to expectation of reward (n = 57) preceded a task-specific reward. It started with the appearance of the final target and ended with the reward. In most cases, the activity was nonselective for how the monkey obtained the reward, i.e., by visual fixation only, by a saccade, or by a hand movement. The activity was dependent partly on visual fixation. 6. A few neurons showed tonic activity selectively before lever release and are thus considered to be related to the preparation of hand movements. 7. The activity related to breaking fixation (n = 33) occurred phasically if the monkey broke fixation, aborting the trial. 8. Activity related to reward (n = 104) was a phasic discharge that occurred before or after a reward of water was delivered. The activity was not simply related to a specific movement involved in the reward-obtaining behavior (eye, hand, or mouth movement). 9. Fixation-related activity (n = 72) was tonic activity continuing as long as the monkey attentively fixated a spot of light. It was dependent on reward expectancy in most cases. 10. The present results, together with those in the preceding papers, indicate that the activities of individual caudate neurons--sensory, motor, or cognitive--are dependent on specific contexts of learned behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Neocortex network activity varies from a desynchronized or activated state typical of arousal to a synchronized or deactivated state typical of quiescence. Such changes are usually attributed to the effects of neuromodulators released in the neocortex by nonspecific activating systems originating in basal forebrain and brain stem reticular formation. As a result, the only role attributed to thalamocortical cells projecting to primary sensory areas, such as barrel cortex, is to transmit sensory information. However, thalamocortical cells can undergo significant changes in spontaneous tonic firing as a function of state, although the role of such variations is unknown. Here we show that the tonic firing level of thalamocortical cells, produced by cholinergic and noradrenergic stimulation of the somatosensory thalamus in urethane-anesthetized rats, controls neocortex activation and deactivation. Thus in addition to its well-known role in the relay of sensory information, the thalamus can control the state of neocortex activation, which may complement the established roles in this regard of basal forebrain and brain stem nuclei. Because of the topographical organization of primary thalamocortical pathways, this mechanism provides a means by which area-specific neocortical activation can occur, which may be useful for modality-specific sensory processing or selective attention.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Many behaviors are affected by rewards, undergoing long-term changes when rewards are different than predicted but remaining unchanged when rewards occur exactly as predicted. The discrepancy between reward occurrence and reward prediction is termed an 'error in reward prediction'. Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area are believed to be involved in reward-dependent behaviors. Consistent with this role, they are activated by rewards, and because they are activated more strongly by unpredicted than by predicted rewards they may play a role in learning. The present study investigated whether monkey dopamine neurons code an error in reward prediction during the course of learning. Dopamine neuron responses reflected the changes in reward prediction during individual learning episodes; dopamine neurons were activated by rewards during early trials, when errors were frequent and rewards unpredictable, but activation was progressively reduced as performance was consolidated and rewards became more predictable. These neurons were also activated when rewards occurred at unpredicted times and were depressed when rewards were omitted at the predicted times. Thus, dopamine neurons code errors in the prediction of both the occurrence and the time of rewards. In this respect, their responses resemble the teaching signals that have been employed in particularly efficient computational learning models.},

The authors propose that the ERN is generated when a negative reinforcement learning signal is conveyed to the anterior cingulate cortex via the mesencephalic dopamine system and that this signal is used by the anterior cingulate cortex to modify performance on the task at hand.

A less well known fact is that the GPi also projects to the lateral habenula (LHb) which is often associated with the limbic system. Using the monkey performing a saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes, we found that antidromically identified LHb-projecting neurons were distributed mainly in the dorsal and ventral borders of the GPi and that their activity was strongly modulated by expected reward outcomes. A majority of them were excited by the no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by the reward-predicting target. These reward-dependent modulations were similar to those in LHb neurons but started earlier than those in LHb neurons. These results suggest that GPi may initiate reward-related signals through its effects on the LHb, which then influences the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.},

Yet LHb neurons are largely glutamatergic, indicating that this inhibition may occur through an intermediate structure. Recent studies in rats have suggested a candidate for this role, the GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), but this neural pathway has not yet been tested directly. We now show using electrophysiology and anatomic tracing that (1) the monkey has an inhibitory structure similar to the rat RMTg; (2) RMTg neurons receive excitatory input from the LHb, exhibit negative reward-prediction errors, and send axonal projections near DA soma; and (3) stimulating this structure inhibits DA neurons. Surprisingly, some RMTg neurons responded to reward cues earlier than the LHb, and carry "state-value" signals not found in DA neurons. Thus, our data suggest that the RMTg translates LHb reward-prediction errors (negative) into DA reward-prediction errors (positive), while transmitting additional motivational signals to non-DA networks.},

The DMS required the animal to recall a projected image of an object over delays of 0, 15, 30 and 45 s. The 3 cryodes were cooled separately during the performance of the DMS and only itg cooling produced a deficit. This was compared to the effects of ablative bilateral lesions; damage to itg but not mtg disrupted performance of DMS. The greatest deficit was in an animal with a small lesion in the ventral pole and anterior extreme of itg. Cooling individual cryodes was without effect on a discrimination between horizontal and vertical stripes, but produced a significant deficit from each of the 3 placements on a discrimination between monkey faces. Chance performance on all visual discriminations resulted from cooling all cryodes. Unilateral cooling of all cryodes produced significant effects on the face discrimination, but there was no significant difference between the two sides in the severity of the deficit.},

  Abstract                 = {While midbrain DA neurons show phasic activations in response to both reward-predicting and salient non-reward events, activation responses to primary and conditioned rewards are sustained for several hundreds of milliseconds beyond those elicited by salient non-reward-related stimuli. The longer-duration DA reward response and corresponding elevated DA release in striatal target sites may selectively strengthen currently-active corticostriatal synapses, i.e., those associated with the successful reward-procuring behavior. This paper describes how similar models of DA-mediated plasticity of corticostriatal synapses may describe both stimulus-response and response-outcome learning. DA-mediated strengthening of corticostriatal synapses in regions of the dorsolateral striatum receiving afferents from primary sensorimotor cortex is likely to bind corticostriatal inputs representing the previously-emitted movement to striatal outputs contributing to the selection of the next movement segment in a behavioral sequence. Within the striatum, more generally, inputs from distinct regions of the frontal cortex that code independently for movement direction and reward expectation send convergent projections to striatal output cells. DA-mediated strengthening of active corticostriatal synapses promotes the future output of the striatal cell under similar input conditions. This is postulated to promote persistence of neuronal activity in the very cortical cells that drive corticostriatal input, leading to the establishment of sustained reverberatory loops that permit cortical movement-related cells to maintain activity until the appropriate time of movement initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {While it has previously been assumed that mesolimbic dopamine neurons carry a reward signal, recent data from single-unit, microdialysis and voltammetry studies suggest that these neurons respond to a large category of salient and arousing events, including appetitive, aversive, high intensity, and novel stimuli. Elevations in dopamine release within mesolimbic, mesocortical and nigrostriatal target sites coincide with arousal, and the increase in dopamine activity within target sites modulates a number of behavioral functions. However, because dopamine neurons respond to a category of salient events that extend beyond that of reward stimuli, dopamine levels are not likely to code for the reward value of encountered events. The paper (i) examines evidence showing that dopamine neurons respond to salient and arousing change in environmental conditions, regardless of the motivational valence of that change, and (ii) asks how this might shape our thinking about the role of dopamine systems in goal-directed behavior.},

This potentiation is blocked by the specific D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and is occluded by the potentiation induced by cAMP agonists. An agonist of the D2 receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through G alpha i, did not induce potentiation. Although this slow D1/D5 agonist-induced potentiation is partially independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, it seems to share some steps with and is occluded by the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) produced by three repeated trains of nerve stimuli applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Similarly, the D1/D5 antagonist SCH 23390 attenuates the late phase of the LTP induced by repeated trains, and the D1/D5 agonist-induced potentiation is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. These results suggest that the D1/D5 receptor may be involved in the late, protein synthesis-dependent component of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region, either as an ancillary component or as a mediator directly contributing to the late phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Loss of dopamine from the striatum can cause both profound motor deficits, as in Parkinson's disease, and disrupt learning. Yet the effect of dopamine on striatal neurons remains a complex and controversial topic, and is in need of a comprehensive framework. We extend a reduced model of the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) to account for dopaminergic modulation of its intrinsic ion channels and synaptic inputs. We tune our D1 and D2 receptor MSN models using data from a recent large-scale compartmental model. The new models capture the input-output relationships for both current injection and spiking input with remarkable accuracy, despite the order of magnitude decrease in system size. They also capture the paired pulse facilitation shown by MSNs. Our dopamine models predict that synaptic effects dominate intrinsic effects for all levels of D1 and D2 receptor activation. We analytically derive a full set of equilibrium points and their stability for the original and dopamine modulated forms of the MSN model. We find that the stability types are not changed by dopamine activation, and our models predict that the MSN is never bistable. Nonetheless, the MSN models can produce a spontaneously bimodal membrane potential similar to that recently observed in vitro following application of NMDA agonists. We demonstrate that this bimodality is created by modelling the agonist effects as slow, irregular and massive jumps in NMDA conductance and, rather than a form of bistability, is due to the voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors. Our models also predict a more pronounced membrane potential bimodality following D1 receptor activation. This work thus establishes reduced yet accurate dopamine-modulated models of MSNs, suitable for use in large-scale models of the striatum. More importantly, these provide a tractable framework for further study of dopamine's effects on computation by individual neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {The basal ganglia are often conceptualised as three parallel domains that include all the constituent nuclei. The 'ventral domain' appears to be critical for learning flexible behaviours for exploration and foraging, as it is the recipient of converging inputs from amygdala, hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex, putatively centres for stimulus evaluation, spatial navigation, and planning/contingency, respectively. However, compared to work on the dorsal domains, the rich potential for quantitative theories and models of the ventral domain remains largely untapped, and the purpose of this review is to provide the stimulus for this work. We systematically review the ventral domain's structures and internal organisation, and propose a functional architecture as the basis for computational models. Using a full schematic of the structure of inputs to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), we argue for the existence of many identifiable processing channels on the basis of unique combinations of afferent inputs. We then identify the potential information represented in these channels by reconciling a broad range of studies from the hippocampal, amygdala and prefrontal cortex literatures with known properties of the ventral striatum from lesion, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies. Dopamine's key role in learning is reviewed within the three current major computational frameworks; we also show that the shell-based basal ganglia sub-circuits are well placed to generate the phasic burst and dip responses of dopaminergic neurons. We detail dopamine's modulation of ventral basal ganglia's inputs by its actions on pre-synaptic terminals and post-synaptic membranes in the striatum, arguing that the complexity of these effects hint at computational roles for dopamine beyond current ideas. The ventral basal ganglia are revealed as a constellation of multiple functional systems for the learning and selection of flexible behaviours and of behavioural strategies, sharing the common operations of selection-by-disinhibition and of dopaminergic modulation.},

In the present study, the relative distributions of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor mRNAs were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry in whole hemisphere sections from normal human post mortem brains. The findings confirmed information documented from single structure examination that the highest expression of both the D1 and D2 mRNAs were localized to the striatum. The cerebral cortex expressed moderate D1 mRNA in all regions with the highest signal in the medial orbital frontal area (Brodmann areas 11, 14), the paraterminal gyrus (Brodmann area 32) and the insular cortex (Brodmann areas 13-16), whereas the D2 mRNA expression had very low cortical expression. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and islands of Calleja had high expression of the D1 mRNA and moderate D2 mRNA levels. Moderate to high expression of the D2 mRNA was evident in the hippocampal formation, parafascicular and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, geniculate bodies, subthalamic nucleus, and pineal gland, all of which were devoid of, or showed only faint, D1 mRNA expression. Brainstem regions, e.g. substantia nigra, red nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial lemniscus, and pontine nuclei expressed D2, but not D1, mRNA. These results emphasize the differential anatomical localization of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor mRNA neuronal populations in the human brain. The restricted expression of the D1 mRNA to the cortical mantle and to a few forebrain structures indicates a strong involvement of the D1 system in cognitive function.},

Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that could be blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione and D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid were evoked onto reticulata GABAergic projection neurons by local field stimulation inside the subthalamic nucleus in the presence of bicuculline. Bath application of (RS)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF-38393), a dopaminergic D1-class receptor agonist, increased evoked EPSCs by approximately 30\% whereas the D2-class receptor agonist, trans-(-)-4aR-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-g)quinoline (quinpirole), reduced EPSCs by approximately 25\%. These apparently opposing actions were blocked by the specific D1- and D2-class receptor antagonists: R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-1H-3-benzazepinehydrochloride (SCH 23390) and S-(-)-5-amino-sulfonyl-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-methyl]-2-methoxybenzamide (sulpiride), respectively. Both effects were accompanied by changes in the paired-pulse ratio, indicative of a presynaptic site of action. The presynaptic location of dopamine receptors at the subthalamonigral projections was confirmed by mean-variance analysis. The effects of both SKF-38393 and quinpirole could be observed on terminals contacting the same postsynaptic neuron. Sulpiride and SCH 23390 enhanced and reduced the evoked EPSC, respectively, suggesting a constitutive receptor activation probably arising from endogenous dopamine. These data suggest that dopamine presynaptically modulates the subthalamic projection that targets GABAergic neurons of the SNr. Implications of this modulation for basal ganglia function are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Reductionist attempts to dissect complex mechanisms into simpler elements are necessary, but not sufficient for understanding how biological properties like reward emerge out of neuronal activity. Recent studies on intracranial self-administration of neurochemicals (drugs) found that rats learn to self-administer various drugs into the mesolimbic dopamine structures-the posterior ventral tegmental area, medial shell nucleus accumbens and medial olfactory tubercle. In addition, studies found roles of non-dopaminergic mechanisms of the supramammillary, rostromedial tegmental and midbrain raphe nuclei in reward. To explain intracranial self-administration and related effects of various drug manipulations, I outlined a neurobiological theory claiming that there is an intrinsic central process that coordinates various selective functions (including perceptual, visceral, and reinforcement processes) into a global function of approach. Further, this coordinating process for approach arises from interactions between brain structures including those structures mentioned above and their closely linked regions: the medial prefrontal cortex, septal area, ventral pallidum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic areas, lateral habenula, periaqueductal gray, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and parabrachical area.},

It also allows comparison with many existing unsupervised methods. This model has been shown successful in various applications such as phoneme and 3D object recognition.

  Abstract                 = {Stable brain function relies on homeostatic maintenance of the functional output of individual neurons. In general, neurons function by converting synaptic input to output as action potential firing. To determine homeostatic mechanisms that balance this input-output/synapse-membrane interaction, we focused on nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons and demonstrated a novel form of synapse-to-membrane homeostatic regulation, homeostatic synapse-driven membrane plasticity (hSMP). Through hSMP, NAc neurons adjusted their membrane excitability to functionally compensate for basal shifts in excitatory synaptic input. Furthermore, hSMP was triggered by synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and expressed by the modification of SK-type Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels. Moreover, hSMP in NAc neurons was abolished in rats during a short- (2 d) or long- (21 d) term withdrawal from repeated intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (15 mg/kg/d, 5 d). These results suggest that hSMP is a novel form of synapse-to-membrane homeostatic plasticity and dysregulation of hSMP may contribute to cocaine-induced cellular alterations in the NAc.},

  Abstract                 = {The hippocampus and amygdala are thought to be functionally distinct components of different learning and memory systems. This functional dissociation has been particularly apparent in pavlovian fear conditioning, where the integrity of the hippocampus is necessary for contextual conditioning, and of the amygdala for discrete cue conditioning. Their respective roles in appetitive conditioning, however, remain equivocal mainly due to the lack of agreement concerning the operational definition of a 'context'. The present study used a novel procedure to measure appetitive conditioning to spatial context or to a discrete cue. Following selective excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus (HPC) or basolateral amygdala (BLA), rats were initially trained to acquire discrete CS-sucrose conditioning in a Y-maze apparatus with three topographically identical chambers, the chambers discriminated only on the basis of path integration. The same group of animals then underwent 'place/contextual conditioning' where the CS presented in a chamber assigned as the positive chamber was paired with sucrose, but the same CS presented in either of the other two chambers was not. Thus, spatial context was the only cue that the animal could use to retrieve the value of the CS. HPC lesions impaired the acquisition of conditioned place preference but facilitated the acquisition of cue conditioning, while BLA lesions had the opposite effect, retarding the acquisition of cue conditioning but leaving the acquisition of conditioned place preference intact. Here we provide strong support for the notion that the HPC and BLA subserve complementary and competing roles in appetitive cue and contextual conditioning.},

  Abstract                 = {In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically comes seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an explanatory conundrum known as "distal reward problem": How does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the extracellular DA concentration during the critical period of a few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network insensitive to the ongoing activity-the key feature that distinguishes our approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement signal in the form of extracellular DA can selectively influence the right synapses at the right time.},

  Abstract                 = {Mice are uniquely suited as experimental subjects for various approaches to the study of the molecular and genetic basis of behavior, and there has been a corresponding explosion in the use of mice in behavioral neuroscience. Rats and monkeys, however, remain the preferred species for high-order cognitive models largely due to the unavailability of valid, reliable and translatable endpoint measures of behavior in the mouse. Here we present further development and validation of a touchscreen-based operant method for measuring cognition that is comparable to methods used in other species and human patients. C57BL/6J mice were found to show good performance on visual discrimination and reversal learning using this method. Demonstrating the sensitivity of the paradigm to genetic factors, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice exhibited marked differences in discrimination and reversal learning. Systemic treatment with the selective D1-like agonist, SKF81297, produced an impairment in the early phase of reversal learning, but did not alter visual discrimination, in C57BL/6J mice. The same treatment impaired spatial working memory on the T-maze delayed alternation task, but did not alter control measures of behavior including motivation and locomotor activity. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of visual discrimination and reversal learning measured by this method to genetic factors and pharmacological challenge, and thereby provide an extension and further validation of the method for measuring cognition in mice. When combined with emerging molecular techniques uniquely suited to this species such as genetic engineering and RNA modification this paradigm could provide a powerful new tool for behavioral neuroscience.},

We show that neurons in the recently identified GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which receive a major LHb input, project heavily to midbrain dopamine neurons, and show phasic activations and/or Fos induction after aversive stimuli (footshocks, shock-predictive cues, food deprivation, or reward omission) and inhibitions after rewards or reward-predictive stimuli. RMTg lesions markedly reduce passive fear behaviors (freezing, open-arm avoidance) dependent on the extended amygdala, periaqueductal gray, or septum, all regions that project directly to the RMTg. In contrast, RMTg lesions spare or enhance active fear responses (treading, escape) in these same paradigms. These findings suggest that aversive inputs from widespread brain regions and stimulus modalities converge onto the RMTg, which opposes reward and motor-activating functions of midbrain dopamine neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {A large number of computational models of information processing in the basal ganglia have been developed in recent years. Prominent in these are actor-critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor-critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to 'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching.},

  Abstract                 = {This Commentary compares the connections of the dopaminergic system with the striatum in rats and primates with respect to two levels of striatal organization: a tripartite functional (motor, associative and limbic) subdivision and a compartmental (patch/striosome-matrix) subdivision. The topography of other basal ganglia projections to the dopaminergic system with respect to their tripartite functional subdivision is also reviewed. This examination indicates that, in rats and primates, the following observations can be made. (1) The limbic striatum reciprocates its dopaminergic input and in addition innervates most of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the associative and motor striatum, whereas the motor and associative striatum reciprocate only part of their dopaminergic input. Therefore, the connections of the three striatal subregions with the dopaminergic system are asymmetrical, but the direction of asymmetry differs between the limbic versus the motor and associative striatum. (2) The limbic striatum provides the main striatal input to dopamine cell bodies and proximal dendrites, with some contribution from a subset of neurons in the associative and motor striatum (patch neurons in rats; an unspecified group of neurons in primates), while striatal input to the ventrally extending dopamine dendrites arises mainly from a subset of neurons in the associative and motor striatum (matrix neurons in rats; an unspecified group of neurons in primates). (3) Projections from functionally corresponding subdivisions of the striatum, pallidum and subthalamic nucleus to the dopaminergic system overlap, but the specific targets (dopamine cells, dopamine dendrites, GABA cells) of these projections differ. Major differences include the following. (1) In rats, neurons projecting to the motor and associative striatum reside in distinct regions, while in primates they are arranged in interdigitating clusters. (2) In rats, the terminal fields of projections arising from the motor and associative striatum are largely segregated, while in primates they are not. (3) In rats, patch- and matrix-projecting dopamine cells are organized in spatially, morphologically, histochemically and hodologically distinct ventral and dorsal tiers, while in primates there is no (bi)division of the dopaminergic system that results in two areas which have all the characteristics of the two tiers in rats. Based on the anatomical data and known dopamine cell physiology, we forward an hypothesis regarding the influence of the basal ganglia on dopamine cell activity which captures at least part of the complex interplay taking place within the substantia nigra between projections arising from the different basal ganglia nuclei. Finally, we incorporate the striatal connections with the dopaminergic system into an open-interconnected scheme of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuroimaging studies of normal subjects and studies of patients with focal lesions implicate regions of parietal cortex in verbal working memory (VWM), yet the precise role of parietal cortex in VWM remains unclear. Some evidence (; ) suggests that the parietal cortex mediates the storage of verbal information, but these studies and most previous ones included encoding and retrieval processes as well as storage and rehearsal of verbal information. A recent positron emission tomography (PET) study by isolated storage and rehearsal from other VWM processes and did not find reliable activation in parietal cortex. This result suggests that parietal cortex may not be involved in VWM storage, contrary to previous proposals. However, we report two behavioral studies indicating that some of the verbal material used by may not have required phonological representations in VWM. In addition, we report a PET study that isolated VWM encoding, retrieval, and storage and rehearsal processes in different PET scans and used material likely to require phonological codes in VWM. After subtraction of appropriate controls, the encoding condition revealed no reliable activations; the retrieval condition revealed reliable activations in dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and extrastriate cortices, and the storage condition revealed reliable activations in dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior frontal, premotor, and posterior parietal cortices, as well as cerebellum. These results suggest that parietal regions are part of a network of brain areas that mediate the short-term storage and retrieval of phonologically coded verbal material.},

Here, we suggest that the temporal dynamics of the response of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) enable the basal ganglia to have a dual role. The fast \{DAN\} response to salient events is mediated thorough the brainstem-basal ganglia loop. Forebrain loops enable the second phase of the dopaminergic responses that require highly processed information. The convergent encoding of fast/salient and slow/detailed information suggests that the basal ganglia control the tradeoff between fast and immediate responses to environmental events and slow responses that are only executed after substantial environmental information has been gathered.},

  Abstract                 = {The reinforcement omission effects (ROEs) have been attributed to both motivational and attentional consequences of the surprising reinforcement omission. Some studies have been showed amygdala is part of a circuit involved in the ROEs modulation. The view that amygdala lesions interfere with the ROEs is supported by evidence involving amygdala in responses correlated with motivational processes. These processes depend on the operation of separate amygdala areas and their connections with other brain systems. It has been suggested the interaction between the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens (NAC) is important to the modulation of motivational processes. Recent neuroimaging studies in human revealed reward delivery enhances activity of subcortical structures (NAC and amygdala), whereas reward omission reduces the activity in these same structures. The present study aimed to clarify whether the mechanisms related to ROEs depend on NAC. Prior to acquisition training, rats received bilateral excitotoxic lesions of NAC (NAC group) or sham lesions (Sham group). Following postoperative recovery, the rats were trained on a fixed-interval with limited hold signaled schedule of reinforcement. After acquisition of stable performance, the training was changed from 100\% to 50\% schedule of reinforcement. Both NAC and Sham groups presented the ROEs. However, after nonreinforcement, the response rates of the NAC group were lower than those registered in the Sham group. The performance of the NAC group decreased in the period following nonreinforcement when compared to the period preceding reinforcement omission. These findings suggest the NAC is part of the neural substrate involved in the ROEs modulation.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to achieve a better understanding of the integration in striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) of converging signals from glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents. The review of the literature in the first section shows that these two types of afferents not only contact the same striatal cell type, but that individual MSNs receive both a corticostriatal and a dopaminergic terminal. The most common sites of convergence are dendritic shafts and spines of MSNs with a distance between the terminals of less than 1-2 microns. The second section focuses on synaptic transmission and second messenger activation. Glutamate, the candidate transmitter of corticostriatal terminals, via different types of glutamate receptors can evoke an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations. The net effect of dopamine in the striatum is a stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity leading to an increase in cAMP. The subsequent sections present information on calcium- and cAMP-sensitive biochemical pathways and review the regional and subcellular distribution of the components in the striatum. The specific biochemical reaction steps were formalized as simplified equilibrium equations. Parameter values of the model were chosen from published experimental data. Major results of this analysis are: at intracellular free calcium concentrations below 1 microM the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by calcium and dopamine is at least additive in the steady state. Free calcium concentrations exceeding 1 microM inhibit adenylate cyclase, which is not overcome by dopaminergic stimulation. The kinases and phosphatases studied can be divided in those that are almost exclusively calcium-sensitive (PP2B and CaMPK), and others that are modulated by both calcium and dopamine (PKA and PP1). Maximal threonine-phosphorylation of the phosphoprotein DARPP requires optimal concentrations of calcium (about 0.3 microM) and dopamine (above 5 microM). It seems favourable if the glutamate signal precedes phasic dopamine release by approximately 100 msec. The phosphorylation of MAP2 is under essentially calcium-dependent control of at least five kinases and phosphatases, which differentially affect its heterogeneous phosphorylation sites. Therefore, MAP2 could respond specifically to the spatio-temporal characteristics of different intracellular calcium fluxes. The quantitative description of the calcium- and dopamine-dependent regulation of DARPP and MAP2 provides insights into the crosstalk between glutamatergic and dopaminergic signals in striatal MSNs. Such insights constitute an important step towards a better understanding of the links between biochemical pathways, physiological processes, and behavioural consequences connected with striatal function. The relevance to long-term potentiation, reinforcement learning, and Parkinson's disease is discussed.},

In this paper, we hypothesize that an intrinsic motivation to progress in learning is at the origins of the remarkable structure of children's developmental trajectories. In this view, children engage in exploratory and playful activities for their own sake, not as steps toward other extrinsic goals. The central hypothesis of this paper is that intrinsically motivating activities correspond to expected decrease in prediction error. This motivation system pushes the infant to avoid both predictable and unpredictable situations in order to focus on the ones that are expected to maximize progress in learning. Based on a computational model and a series of robotic experiments, we show how this principle can lead to organized sequences of behavior of increasing complexity characteristic of several behavioral and developmental patterns observed in humans. We then discuss the putative circuitry underlying such an intrinsic motivation system in the brain and formulate two novel hypotheses. The first one is that tonic dopamine acts as a learning progress signal. The second is that this progress signal is directly computed through a hierarchy of microcortical circuits that act both as prediction and metaprediction systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A delayed-match-to-sample task was used to assess memory for motor responses in rats with control, hippocampus, or medial caudate nucleus (MCN) lesions. All testing was conducted on a cheeseboard maze in complete darkness using an infrared camera. A start box was positioned in the centre of the maze facing a randomly determined direction on each trial. On the sample phase, a phosphorescent object was randomly positioned to cover a baited food well in one of five equally spaced positions around the circumference of the maze forming a 180-degree arc 60 cm from the box. The rat had to displace the object to receive food and return to the start box. The box was then rotated to face a different direction. An identical baited phosphorescent object was placed in the same position relative to the start box. A second identical object was positioned to cover a different unbaited well. On the choice phase, the rat must remember the motor response made on the sample phase and make the same motor response on the choice phase to receive a reward. Hippocampus lesioned and control rats improved as a function of increased angle separation used to separate the correct object from the foil (45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees) and matched the performance of controls. However, rats with MCN lesions were impaired across all separations. Results suggest that the MCN, but not the hippocampus, supports working memory and/or a process aimed at reducing interference for motor response selection based on vector angle information.},

Here we attempt to unify the two. We review one powerful theory for distinct forms of learning during instrumental conditioning, namely model-based (maintaining a representation of the world) and model-free (reacting to immediate stimuli) learning algorithms. We extend these lines of argument to propose an alternative taxonomy for spatial navigation, showing how various previously identified strategies can be distinguished as "model-based" or "model-free" depending on the usage of information and not on the type of information (e.g., cue vs. place). We argue that identifying "model-free" learning with dorsolateral striatum and "model-based" learning with dorsomedial striatum could reconcile numerous conflicting results in the spatial navigation literature. From this perspective, we further propose that the ventral striatum plays key roles in the model-building process. We propose that the core of the ventral striatum is positioned to learn the probability of action selection for every transition between states of the world. We further review suggestions that the ventral striatal core and shell are positioned to act as "critics" contributing to the computation of a reward prediction error for model-free and model-based systems, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of synapses formed by corticostriatal neurons was measured to determine the average connectivity and degree of convergence of these neurons and to search for spatial inhomogeneities. Two kinds of axonal fields, focal and extended, and two striatal tissue compartments, the patch (striosome) and matrix, were analyzed separately. Electron microscopic examination revealed that both kinds of corticostriatal axons made synapses at varicosities that could be identified in the light microscope, and each varicosity made a single synapse. Thus, the distribution of varicosities was a good estimate of the spatial distribution of synapses. The distance between axonal varicosities was measured to determine the density of synaptic connections formed by one axon within the volume occupied by a striatal neuron. Intersynaptic distances were distributed exponentially, except that synapses were rarely located <4 microm apart. The mean distance between synapses was approximately 10 microm, so axons made a maximum of 40 synapses within the dendritic volume of a spiny neuron. There are approximately 2840 spiny neurons located within the volume of the dendrites of one spiny cell (Oorschot, 1996), so each axon must contact </=1.4\% of all cells in its axonal arborization. Within the same volume there are approximately 30.5 million asymmetric synapses (Ingham et al., 1996), approximately half of which are cortical in origin. Thus, approximately 380,000 cortical axons innervate the volume of the dendritic tree of one spiny cell. Striatal neurons with totally overlapping dendritic volumes have few presynaptic cortical axons in common, and cortical cells with overlapping axons have few striatal target neurons in common. These results explain the absence of redundancy in the responses of neurons located near each other in the striatum.},

  Abstract                 = {Timing and prediction error learning have historically been treated as independent processes, but growing evidence has indicated that they are not orthogonal. Timing emerges at the earliest time point when conditioned responses are observed, and temporal variables modulate prediction error learning in both simple conditioning and cue competition paradigms. In addition, prediction errors, through changes in reward magnitude or value alter timing of behavior. Thus, there appears to be a bi-directional interaction between timing and prediction error learning. Modern theories have attempted to integrate the two processes with mixed success. A neurocomputational approach to theory development is espoused, which draws on neurobiological evidence to guide and constrain computational model development. Heuristics for future model development are presented with the goal of sparking new approaches to theory development in the timing and prediction error fields.

Stimulus conditioning consisted of a random 15-s duration conditioned stimulus (CS) followed by food; temporal conditioning consisted of food-food intervals of fixed 90 s (Experiment 1) or fixed 75 + random 15 s (Experiment 2). The stimulus group abruptly increased responding after CS onset, and the temporal group gradually increased responding over the food-food interval. When the food-food interval was fixed 90 s, the temporal cue exerted stronger control in the compound, whereas when the food-food interval was fixed 75 + random 15 s, the stimulus cue exerted stronger control. The strength of conditioning, temporal gradients of responding, and cue competition effects appear to reflect simultaneous timing of multiple intervals.},

  Abstract                 = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays a pivotal role in controlling the activity of both the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GPe and GPi, respectively). Both nuclei receive monosynaptic excitatory and disynaptic GPe-mediated inhibitory inputs from the STN. Thus, we investigated the balance of these antagonistic inputs that may determine the overall response of pallidum to STN activation in monkeys. Single stimulation of the STN evoked a short-latency excitation followed by a weak inhibition in GPe neurons and a short-latency, very short-duration excitation followed by a strong inhibition in GPi neurons. Burst high-frequency stimulation (BHFS) (10 stimuli with 100 Hz) of the STN (STN-BHFS) evoked powerful excitatory responses in GPe neurons. Local injection of a mixture of 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2, 3-dioxobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX; AMPA/kainate receptor blocker) and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP; NMDA receptor blocker) greatly diminished or abolished excitatory responses to the STN stimulation. In contrast to the GPe, STN-BHFS evoked a predominantly inhibitory response in GPi neurons. The inhibition could be blocked either by a local application of the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine or by an injection of an NBQX/CPP/gabazine mixture into the GPe. STN-BHFS induced weak excitatory or inhibitory responses in a small number of phasically active putamen neurons. These data suggest that with single stimulation and during STN-BHFS, the STN-GPe excitatory response dominates over the STN-GPe-GPe recurrent inhibition in the GPe, whereas the STN-GPe-GPi inhibitory response dominates over the STN-GPi excitatory response in the GPi.},

Counting neurons labeled with WGA-HRP and those stained with neuronal markers indicated that approximately 30\% of GPe neurons project to neostriatum. Approximately 2/3 of the pallidostriatal neurons are PV-immunoreactive. This study revealed that a significant number of primate GPe PV immunoreactive neurons project to the neostriatum, and suggest that the pallidostriatal projection should be taken into account in the analysis of functional roles of the basal ganglia circuitry.},

  Abstract                 = {Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently the most common therapeutic surgical procedure for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have failed medical management. However, a recent summary of clinical evidence on the effectiveness of STN DBS is lacking. We report the results of such a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive review of the literature using Medline and Ovid databases from 1993 until 2004 was conducted. Estimates of change in absolute Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores after surgery were generated using random-effects models. Sources of heterogeneity were explored with meta-regression models, and the possibility of publication bias was evaluated. Patient demographics, reduction in medication requirements, change in dyskinesia, daily offs, quality of life, and a ratio of postoperative improvement from stimulation compared to preoperative improvement by medication from each study were tabulated and average scores were calculated. Adverse effects from each study were summarized. Thirty-seven cohorts were included in the review. Twenty-two studies with estimates of standard errors were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated decreases in absolute UPDRS II (activities of daily living) and III (motor) scores after surgery in the stimulation ON/medication off state compared to preoperative medication off state were 13.35 (95\% CI: 10.85-15.85; 50\%) and 27.55 (95\% CI: 24.23-30.87; 52\%), respectively. Average reduction in L-dopa equivalents following surgery was 55.9\% (95\% CI: 50\%-61.8\%). Average reduction in dyskinesia following surgery was 69.1\% (95\% CI: 62.0\%-76.2\%). Average reduction in daily off periods was 68.2\% (95\% CI: 57.6\%-78.9\%). Average improvement in quality of life using PDQ-39 was 34.5\% +/- 15.3\%. Univariable regression showed improvements in UPDRS III scores were significantly greater in studies with higher baseline UPDRS III off scores, increasing disease duration prior to surgery, earlier year of publication, and higher baseline L-dopa responsiveness. Average baseline UPDRS III off scores were significantly lower (i.e., suggesting milder disease) in later than in earlier studies. In multivariable regression, L-dopa responsiveness, higher baseline motor scores, and disease duration were independent predictors of greater change in motor score. No evidence of publication bias in the available literature was found. The most common serious adverse event related to surgery was intracranial hemorrhage in 3.9\% of patients. Psychiatric sequelae were common. Synthesis of the available literature indicates that STN DBS improves motor activity and activities of daily living in advanced PD. Differences between available studies likely reflect differences in patient populations and follow-up periods. These data provide an estimate of the magnitude of the treatment effects and emphasize the need for controlled and randomized studies.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we address the role of neuronal activity in the pathways of the brainstem-midbrain circuit in reward and the basis for believing that this circuit provides advantages over previous reinforcement learning theory. Several lines of evidence support the reward-based learning theory proposing that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons send a teaching signal (the reward prediction error signal) to control synaptic plasticity of the projection area. However, the underlying mechanism of where and how the reward prediction error signal is computed still remains unclear. Since the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN) in the brainstem is one of the strongest excitatory input sources to DA neurons, we hypothesized that the PPTN may play an important role in activating DA neurons and reinforcement learning by relaying necessary signals for reward prediction error computation to DA neurons. To investigate the involvement of the PPTN neurons in computation of reward prediction error, we used a visually guided saccade task (VGST) during recording of neuronal activity in monkeys. Here, we predict that PPTN neurons may relay the excitatory component of tonic reward prediction and phasic primary reward signals, and derive a new computational theory of the reward prediction error in DA neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {The neural responses of 456 single units were recorded in parietal cortex of behaving monkeys during a haptic delayed matching-to-sample task. (1) In areas 2 and 5 together, 22\% of the neurons were activated by the auditory cue that signalled the beginning of a trial. Virtually all of these cells were also activated during the arm movements required by the task. These neurons, showing both auditory-related and movement-related responses, may function in sensorimotor integration. (2) Responses related to arm projection frequently began before movement onset, sometimes as much as 320 ms before. Such "premovement" responses were approximately equally common, and showed the same latency distribution, in areas 2, 5a, and 5b. (3) There was a topographic rostral-to-caudal gradient of decreasing neural responsiveness to the animal's manipulation of the cue (sample) objects. Eleven percent of manipulation-activated cells responded preferentially to one of the sample objects. (4) Many cells showed sustained (greater than 3 s) activation during the delay period (the time between handling of the sample object and palpation of the choice objects), even though at that time the monkey was sitting quietly and without stimulation. (5) Cells with sustained activation throughout most or all of the 18-s delay period were rare in all areas tested except area 5a. These cells, especially those that were preferentially activated depending on which sample object was palpated, may function in the temporary retention of haptic attributes. (6) The population of cells activated during sample manipulation was largely distinct from the population of cells showing sustained activation during the delay period. These two cell populations may represent different but complementary aspects of haptic perception. (7) The most common response during the delay period was sustained inhibition. This may be an expression of a nonspecific mechanism for decreasing background noise and enhancing neural responses to an anticipated perceptual event. (8) Relatively little evidence was found to support a functional distinction between the neural response properties of areas 2 and 5a. This suggests that area 2 may be at a higher level in the somatosensory hierarchy of the posterior parietal cortex than usually considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Activity of dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons was examined in rhesus monkeys while they performed a spatial delayed-response task with delays of 2, 4, 8 or 12 s interposed between cue and response. Of the 600 neurons recorded for at least 10 trials under each delay condition, 95 displayed a pattern of discharge during the delay period which was significantly different from neuronal firing before or after this period. Changes in the duration of the delay elicit two distinct patterns of activity in these neurons: some (59/95, 62\%) exhibit a fixed pattern of discharge regardless of the duration of the ensuing delay; others (31/95, 33\%) alter their pattern of activity in relation to the temporal changes. Although both types of delay-related neurons display a variety of discharge profiles, more than half of each class exhibit their highest activity in the early part of the delay period. A related finding concerns a small subclass of spatially selective neurons which fire significantly more when the cue is presented on the left than on the right or vice versa. A striking 80\% of these spatially discriminative neurons exhibit peak activity in the first few seconds of the delay period. These findings provide cellular evidence that (1) prefrontal neurons are responsive to temporal as well as spatial features of the delayed-response task; and (2) the involvement of a subset of these is particularly critical in the first few seconds of the delay. The latter finding emphasizes that prefrontal neurons may play an important role in the registration process of spatial memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Reward is important for shaping goal-directed behaviour. After stimulus-reward associative learning, an organism can assess the motivational value of the incoming stimuli on the basis of past experience (retrospective processing), and predict forthcoming rewarding events (prospective processing). The traditional role of the sensory thalamus is to relay current sensory information to cortex. Here we find that non-primary thalamic neurons respond to reward-related events in two ways. The early, phasic responses occurred shortly after the onset of the stimuli and depended on the sensory modality. Their magnitudes resisted extinction and correlated with the learning experience. The late responses gradually increased during the cue and delay periods, and peaked just before delivery of the reward. These responses were independent of sensory modality and were modulated by the value and timing of the reward. These observations provide new evidence that single thalamic neurons can code for the acquired significance of sensory stimuli in the early responses (retrospective coding) and predict upcoming reward value in the late responses (prospective coding).},

  Abstract                 = {In the fear conditioning literature, it is generally hypothesized that neurons in the basolateral amygdalar complex (BLA) (lateral and basal nuclei) support the formation of conditioned fear memory and project to neurons in the central nucleus (CeA) for the expression of conditioned fear responses. According to this serial processing-transmission view, damage to either BLA or CeA would comparably disrupt the expression of a variety of conditioned fear responses. In the present study, we further investigated the roles of BLA and CeA in fear conditioning by concurrently assessing freezing and 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV) as dependent measures of fear in rats. Selective neurotoxins, NMDA for the BLA and ibotenic acid for the CeA, were used to destroy intrinsic neurons [evidenced by thionin dye and NeuN (neuronal nuclei) antibody stainings] without damaging the fibers of passage (confirmed by myelin staining). During the 10 tone-footshock paired training, postshock freezing and USV responses were significantly impaired in BLA-lesioned animals, whereas CeA-lesioned animals exhibited only mild deficits. Similarly, conditioned fear responses assessed 24 hr after training were severely reduced in BLA-lesioned animals but not in CeA-lesioned animals. In contrast to ibotenic lesions of the CeA, small electrolytic lesions of the CeA strongly affected both postshock and conditioned freezing and USV. Together, these results do not support the currently espoused BLA-to-CeA serial processing-transmission view of fear conditioning. Instead, the expression of conditioned fear appears to primarily involve BLA projections that course through the CeA en route to downstream fear response structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Unilateral infusion of MPTP into the monkey caudate nucleus produced deficits in task-specific saccades, in addition to the deficits in spontaneous eye movements (preceding article). We trained three monkeys to perform two kinds of saccade tasks: (1) saccade task for eliciting visually guided saccades and (2) delayed saccade task for eliciting memory-guided saccades. After the MPTP infusion, dopaminergic function, estimated by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, was shown to be decreased locally around the infusion site at the head-body junction of the caudate. We found that the deficits were prominent in the saccades directed to the side contralateral to the infusion (contralateral saccades). Memory-guided saccades were sometimes misdirected to the ipsilateral side even when the cue stimulus was presented on the contralateral side. Among the parameters of saccades, a selective change was found in the saccade latency: the latency was prolonged consistently in contralateral memory-guided saccades. The amplitude and velocity of saccades decreased in contralateral saccades, either memory guided or visually guided. The duration of saccades tended to increase in visually-guided saccades and memory-guided saccades, in both directions. Only one monkey, in which the decrease in TH activity included a large part of the putamen and the head of the caudate, showed prolongation of manual reaction time for lever release.},

  Abstract                 = {The vertebrate neuromodulatory systems are critical for appropriate value-laden responses to environmental challenges. Whereas changes in the overall level of dopamine (DA) have an effect on the organism's reward or curiosity-seeking behavior, changes in the level of serotonin (5-HT) can affect its level of anxiety or harm aversion. Moreover, top-down signals from frontal cortex can exert cognitive control on these neuromodulatory systems. The cholinergic (ACh) and noradrenergic (NE) systems affect the ability to filter out noise and irrelevant events. We introduce a neural network for action selection that is based on these principles of neuromodulatory systems. The algorithm tested the hypothesis that high levels of serotonin lead to withdrawn behavior by suppressing DA action and that high levels of DA or low levels of 5-HT lead to curious, exploratory behavior. Furthermore, the algorithm tested the idea that top-down signals from the frontal cortex to neuromodulatory areas are critical for an organism to cope with both stressful and novel events. The neural network was implemented on an autonomous robot and tested in an open-field paradigm. The open-field test is often used to test for models anxiety or exploratory behavior in the rodent and allows for qualitative comparisons with the neurorobot's behavior. The present neurorobotic experiments can lead to a better understanding of how neuromodulatory signaling affects the balance between anxious and curious behavior. Therefore, this experimental paradigm may also be informative in exploring a wide range of neurological diseases such as anxiety, autism, attention deficit disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans and animals can perform much more complex tasks than they can acquire using pure trial and error learning. This gap is filled by teaching. One important method of instruction is shaping, in which a teacher decomposes a complete task into sub-components, thereby providing an easier path to learning. Despite its importance, shaping has not been substantially studied in the context of computational modeling of cognitive learning. Here we study the shaping of a hierarchical working memory task using an abstract neural network model as the target learner. Shaping significantly boosts the speed of acquisition of the task compared with conventional training, to a degree that increases with the temporal complexity of the task. Further, it leads to internal representations that are more robust to task manipulations such as reversals. We use the model to investigate some of the elements of successful shaping.},

The neural mechanisms underlying this dynamic network dysfunction, however, are only poorly understood. Here, we show that the strength of inhibitory inputs from striatum to globus pallidus external (GPe) is a key parameter controlling oscillations in the basal ganglia. Specifically, the increase in striatal activity observed in PD is sufficient to unleash the oscillations in the basal ganglia. This finding allows us to propose a unified explanation for different phenomena: absence of oscillation in the healthy state of the basal ganglia, oscillations in dopamine-depleted state and quenching of oscillations under deep-brain-stimulation (DBS). These novel insights help us to better understand and optimize the function of DBS protocols. Furthermore, studying the model behavior under transient increase of activity of the striatal neurons projecting to the indirect pathway, we are able to account for both motor impairment in PD patients and for reduced response inhibition in DBS implanted patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons have important roles in adaptive and pathological brain functions related to reward and motivation. However, it is unknown whether subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons participate in distinct circuits that encode different motivational signatures, and whether inputs to the VTA differentially modulate such circuits. Here we show that, because of differences in synaptic connectivity, activation of inputs to the VTA from the laterodorsal tegmentum and the lateral habenula elicit reward and aversion in mice, respectively. Laterodorsal tegmentum neurons preferentially synapse on dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens lateral shell, whereas lateral habenula neurons synapse primarily on dopamine neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex as well as on GABAergic ($\gamma$-aminobutyric-acid-containing) neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. These results establish that distinct VTA circuits generate reward and aversion, and thereby provide a new framework for understanding the circuit basis of adaptive and pathological motivated behaviours.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have emphasized the importance of dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for working memory (WM) function, although this system has rarely been studied in humans in vivo. However, dopamine and PFC activity can be directly measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), respectively. In this study, we examined WM capacity, dopamine, and PFC function in healthy older participants in order to test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between these 3 factors. We used the PET tracer 6-[18F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine to measure dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum (caudate, putamen), and event-related fMRI to measure brain activation during different epochs (cue, delay, probe) of a WM task. Caudate (but not putamen) dopamine correlated positively with WM capacity, whereas putamen (but not caudate) dopamine correlated positively with motor speed. In addition, delay-related fMRI activation in a left inferior prefrontal region was related to both caudate dopamine and task accuracy, suggesting that this may be a critical site for the integration of WM maintenance processes. These results provide new evidence that striatal dopaminergic function is related to PFC-dependent functions, particularly brain activation and behavioral performance during WM tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {A group of ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) was tested on a series of automated tests of learning, memory, planning and attention whilst either on or off L-dopa medication. Controlled withdrawal of L-dopa interfered with aspects of performance on three of the tests that had previously been shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction; a spatial working memory task, the Tower of London planning test, and a visual discrimination paradigm that also included intra- and extra-dimensional shift tests of selective attention. More specifically, errors were increased in the spatial working memory test, and both the accuracy and latency of thinking were impaired. Thinking time was significantly slowed following L-dopa withdrawal, even though the possible contaminating effects on motor slowing were fully controlled by a yoked control procedure. Nine out of ten patients reached a further stage of the visual discrimination, set-shifting paradigm when on, rather than off, L-dopa medication. Spatial span was also impaired off medication, but there were no effects of L-dopa withdrawal on tests of pattern and spatial recognition memory, simultaneous and delayed matching to sample or visuospatial conditional associative learning. Comparisons with a large control group confirmed previous findings that PD is associated with deficits on the majority of these tests. The results are discussed in terms of the fronto-striatal, dopamine dependent nature of some of the cognitive deficits found in PD, but the apparent dopamine-independent nature of deficits in other aspects of cognitive functioning, notably in tests of visual recognition memory and associative learning.},

  Abstract                 = {It was recently shown that subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesions affect motivation for food, cocaine, and alcohol, differentially, according to either the nature of the reward or the preference for it. The STN may thus code a reward according to its value. Here, we investigated how the firing of subthalamic neurons is modulated during expectation of a predicted reward between two possibilities (4 or 32\% sucrose solution). The firing pattern of neurons responding to predictive cues and to reward delivery indicates that STN neurons can be divided into subpopulations responding specifically to one reward and less or giving no response to the other. In addition, some neurons ("oops" neurons) specifically encode errors as they respond only during error trials. These results reveal that the STN plays a critical role in ascertaining the value of the reward and seems to encode that value differently depending on the magnitude of the reward. These data highlight the importance of the STN in the reward circuitry of the brain.},

It receives additional afferent connections from widespread brain structures and sends additional strong efferent connections to a number of non-dopaminergic brainstem structures and, to a lesser extent, the forebrain. Projection neurons of the RMTg have been shown to express Fos in response to aversive stimuli and/or reward omission and psychostimulant drug administration. This review will first recount how the RMTg was discovered and then describe in greater detail what is known about its neuroanatomical relationships, including afferent and efferent connections, neurotransmitters, and receptors.

This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain. It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such as "affect," "hedonic tone," or "emotional feelings," and used a simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes of the past not be made again. It is also time to expand from this foundation into broader aspects of mind and behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Converging evidence supports a role for mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems in a subject's ability to shift behavior in response to changing stimulus-reward contingencies. To characterize the dopaminergic mechanisms involved in this function, we quantified the effects of subtype-specific dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists on acquisition, retention, and reversal of a visual discrimination task in non-human primates (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). We used a modified Wisconsin General Test Apparatus that was equipped with three food boxes, each fitted with a lid bearing a unique visual cue; one of the cues concealed a food reward, whereas the other two concealed an empty box. The monkeys were trained first to acquire a novel discrimination (eg A(+), B(-), C(-)) in a single session, before experiencing either a reversal of the discrimination (eg A(-), B(+), C(-)) or the acquisition of a completely new discrimination (eg D(+), E(-), F(-)), on the following day. Systemic administration of the D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist raclopride (0.001-0.03 mg/kg) failed to significantly affect the performance of reversal learning when reversal sessions were run without a retention session. But, raclopride (0.03 mg/kg) significantly impaired performance under the reversal condition when reversal sessions were run right after a retention session; however, it did not affect acquisition of a novel visual discrimination. Specifically, raclopride significantly increased the number of reversal errors made before reaching the performance criterion in the reversal, but not in new learning sessions. In contrast, the D(1)/D(5) receptor antagonist SCH 23390 did not significantly modulate acquisition of a novel discrimination or reversal learning at doses (0.001-0.03 mg/kg, i.m.) that did not suppress behavior generally. In addition, none of the drug treatments affected retention of a previously learned discrimination. The results strongly suggest that D(2)/D(3) receptors, but not D(1)/D(5) receptors, selectively mediate reversal learning, without affecting the capacity to learn a new stimulus-reward association. These data support the hypothesis that phasic DA release, acting through D(2)-like receptors, mediates behavioral flexibility.},

To distinguish these factors, we used overlapping stimuli that allowed us to independently manipulate the number of spatial locations while holding constant the number of objects and features to be encoded (Duncan, 1984; Vecera & Farah, 1994). In Experiment 1, the number of spatial locations had no effect on VSTM, suggesting that VSTM is object based. Experiments 2 and 3 ruled out alternative explanations based on perceptual segregation difficulty or decision noise factors. Our results provide additional support to Luck and Vogel's (1997) demonstration that integrated objects form the units of VSTM capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {The central amygdala nucleus (CeA) plays a critical role in cognitive processes beyond fear conditioning. For example, intact CeA function is essential for enhancing attention to conditioned stimuli (CSs). Furthermore, this enhanced attention depends on the CeA's connections to the nigrostriatal system. In the current study, we examined the role of the CeA's connections to two midbrain dopamine regions, the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), in processing CS information when predictions of reward or nonreward were confirmed or disconfirmed. Initially, two different retrograde tracers were injected into the SNc and the VTA of rats, to label CeA cells. Different groups of rats then received a visual CS either paired or unpaired with food. Finally, Fos induction was assessed after a test session in which rats were exposed to the visual CS alone or paired with food. Colabeling of Fos and the retrograde tracer(s) showed that CeA neurons projecting to the SNc, but not to the VTA, were engaged in processing CS information when the training and testing conditions differed. These results suggest that the CeA-nigral pathway represents prediction error information during appetitive conditioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Rats orient to and approach localizable visual cues paired with food delivery. Previous studies from this laboratory show that the acquisition and expression of these learned cue-directed responses depend on integrity of a system including the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Other investigators have suggested that cue-directed behaviors may also depend on interaction between CeA and the ventral striatum, perhaps via CeA projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of unilateral lesions of CeA and/or VTA on rats' acquisition of conditioned responses to visual cues paired with food. Contrary to the results of previous studies that examined interactions of CeA with either SNc or DLS, rats with contralateral disconnection lesions of CeA and VTA were unimpaired in their acquisition of cue-directed responses. By contrast, rats with lesions of both structures in the same hemisphere failed to learn cue-directed responses, but were normal in their acquisition of conditioned responses directed to the food cup. In Experiment 2, we attempted to characterize the influence of VTA on CeA by examining FOS induction in CeA by a visual cue for food in rats with unilateral lesions of VTA. The results suggested an excitatory influence of VTA on CeA in the presence of food cues. Implications of these results for brain circuits involved in learned orienting and incentive motivation are discussed.},

PRh responses during the object-memory task were elevated relative to those during the second task. In TE, on the other hand, there were no significant task-related differences in responses. We did not observe task-related differences related to repetition effects in either brain area. The onset of the enhanced signal in PRh during the object-memory task occurred with a latency of 80 ms after the onset of the stimulus response, suggesting that it was the result of top-down feedback.}

The membrane potential oscillations were of similar frequency and reversed in phase to the extracellular EEG of about 0.5 mV. In freely moving rats, a rhythmic delta EEG of 0.5-3 Hz was found in the nucleus accumbens, and it was of highest amplitude and regularity during awake immobility and face washing, less regular during slow wave sleep, and of the lowest amplitude during body and head movements and rapid eye movement sleep. The behavioural relation of the accumbens EEG was not critically affected after amphetamine, haloperidol, and parachlorophenylalanine, which depleted serotonin, although the accumbens EEG during awake immobility was less regular after blocking muscarinic cholinergic receptors by atropine sulfate. However, stimulation of the ventral tegmental area suppressed the accumbens delta membrane potential oscillations and EEG, and this effect was antagonized by haloperidol, suggesting that endogenous dopamine release may suppress the accumbens delta rhythm. It was concluded that the delta rhythm in the nucleus accumbens may represent a state of bilateral synchrony among accumbens neurons that is perhaps characteristic of an idling system, while desynchronization of the delta rhythm may occur closely with motor action.},

  Abstract                 = {The caudate nucleus is part of an anatomical network subserving functions associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the metabolic activity in the striatum reflects specific changes in working memory tasks, which are known to be dependent on the DLPFC, and whether these changes reflect the topographic ordering of prefrontal connections within the striatum. Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) rates were assessed in the striatum by the 14C-2-deoxyglucose method in monkeys that performed a spatial (delayed spatial alternation), a nonspatial (delayed object alternation) visual working memory task, or tasks that did not involve working memory, i.e., a visual pattern discrimination or sensorimotor paradigm. The results show a topographic segregation of activation related to spatial and nonspatial working memory, respectively. The delayed spatial alternation task increases LCGU rates bilaterally by 33-43\% in the head of the caudate nucleus, where efferents from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex project most densely. The delayed object alternation task enhances LCGU rates bilaterally by 32-37\% in the body of the caudate nucleus, which is innervated by the temporal cortex. The visual pattern discrimination task similarly activated the body of the caudate, but in a smaller region and only in the right hemisphere. These findings provide the first evidence for metabolic activation of the caudate nuclei in working memory, supporting the role of this nucleus as a node in a neural network mediating DLPFC-dependent working memory processes. The double dissociation of activation observed suggests an anatomical and functional segregation of cortico-striatal circuits subserving spatial and nonspatial cognitive operations.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been proposed that an increase in synchronization between neurons in the basal ganglia contributes to the clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD). To examine this hypothesis, we looked for correlations in the discharge activity of pairs of neurons in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), globus pallidus externus (GPe), and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Recordings were performed in PD patients undergoing functional stereotactic mapping for pallidotomy (eight patients) or subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (four patients). A double-microelectrode setup was used to simultaneously record from neurons separated by distances as small as 250 microm. In the five pallidotomy patients without limb tremor during the procedure, none of the 73 GPi pairs and 15 GPe pairs displayed synchronous activity. In the three pallidotomy patients with limb tremor, 6 of 21 GPi pairs and 5 of 29 GPe pairs displayed oscillatory synchronization in the frequency range of the ongoing limb tremor (3-6 Hz) or at higher frequencies (15-30 Hz). Synchronized activity was not observed in the SNr (10 pairs). The findings indicate that oscillatory synchronization between pairs of GPi or GPe neurons is found in patients with limb tremor. These results also suggest that overt neuronal synchronization, which may be attributable to an increase in direct synaptic connections or common collateral afferent inputs, is not present in the basal ganglia of patients with PD.},

Ten healthy volunteers performed a verbal memory task, which allowed different aspects of working memory function such as maintenance, retrieval and manipulation to be tested within the same general paradigm. During performance of this task as a whole, fMRI revealed increases in signal intensity throughout the frontostriatal network. However, when signal intensity during the manipulation of information within working memory was compared to that during periods requiring only simple maintenance and retrieval, significant changes were observed only in the caudate nuclei, bilaterally.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the contribution of individual nuclei to the cortical projection with modern sensitive tracing techniques. Small injections of Miniruby or PHA-L were made into single thalamic nuclei. All thalamic nuclei have in common a projection into the upper portion of layer I of the temporal aspect of the cortical mantle. Furthermore, SG, PIN, MGm and PP each demonstrated a convergent projection to lower layer III and to layer IV of the ectorhinal and visceral cortex. Only MGm projects to layer VI of primary auditory and temporal association cortices. Within the perirhinal cortex zones of convergence and divergence exist. The present results demonstrate a differential thalamocortical projection of single thalamic nuclei to those cortical areas which are involved in the transmission of sensory signals to the amygdala via the thalamocortico-cortical pathway and to the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. The thalamic nuclei are thus in a position to activate the amygdala and to modulate the information flow of the thalamocortico-cortical pathway to both amygdala and hippocampus.},

  Abstract                 = {Anatomic and behavioral evidence shows that TE and perirhinal cortices are two directly connected but distinct inferior temporal areas. Despite this distinctness, physiological properties of neurons in these two areas generally have been similar with neurons in both areas showing selectivity for complex visual patterns and showing response modulations related to behavioral context in the sequential delayed match-to-sample (DMS) trials, attention, and stimulus familiarity. Here we identify physiological differences in the neuronal activity of these two areas. We recorded single neurons from area TE and perirhinal cortex while the monkeys performed a simple behavioral task using randomly interleaved visually cued reward schedules of one, two, or three DMS trials. The monkeys used the cue's relation to the reward schedule (indicated by the brightness) to adjust their behavioral performance. They performed most quickly and most accurately in trials in which reward was immediately forthcoming and progressively less well as more intermediate trials remained. Thus the monkeys appeared more motivated as they progressed through the trial schedule. Neurons in both TE and perirhinal cortex responded to both the visual cues related to the reward schedules and the stimulus patterns used in the DMS trials. As expected, neurons in both areas showed response selectivity to the DMS patterns, and significant, but small, modulations related to the behavioral context in the DMS trial. However, TE and perirhinal neurons showed strikingly different response properties. The latency distribution of perirhinal responses was centered 66 ms later than the distribution of TE responses, a larger difference than the 10-15 ms usually found in sequentially connected visual cortical areas. In TE, cue-related responses were related to the cue's brightness. In perirhinal cortex, cue-related responses were related to the trial schedules independently of the cue's brightness. For example, some perirhinal neurons responded in the first trial of any reward schedule including the one trial schedule, whereas other neurons failed to respond in the first trial but respond in the last trial of any schedule. The majority of perirhinal neurons had more complicated relations to the schedule. The cue-related activity of TE neurons is interpreted most parsimoniously as a response to the stimulus brightness, whereas the cue-related activity of perirhinal neurons is interpreted most parsimoniously as carrying associative information about the animal's progress through the reward schedule. Perirhinal cortex may be part of a system gauging the relation between work schedules and rewards.},

Here, we apply a recombinant DNA technique to investigate the role of dopamine D2 receptor in rhinal cortex for this type of learning. Rhinal cortex was injected with a DNA construct that significantly decreased D2 receptor ligand binding and temporarily produced the same profound learning deficit seen after ablation. However, unlike after ablation, the D2 receptor-targeted, DNA-treated monkeys recovered cue-related learning after 11-19 weeks. Injecting a DNA construct that decreased N-methyl-d-aspartate but not D2 receptor ligand binding did not interfere with learning associations between the cues and the schedules. A second D2 receptor-targeted DNA treatment administered after either recovery from a first D2 receptor-targeted DNA treatment (one monkey), after N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-targeted DNA treatment (two monkeys), or after a vector control treatment (one monkey) also induced a learning deficit of similar duration. These results suggest that the D2 receptor in primate rhinal cortex is essential for learning to relate the visual cues to the schedules. The specificity of the receptor manipulation reported here suggests that this approach could be generalized in this or other brain pathways to relate molecular mechanisms to cognitive functions.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Previous studies have shown that dopamine (DA) neurons respond to stimuli of behavioral significance, such as primary reward and conditioned stimuli predicting reward and eliciting behavioral reactions. The present study investigated how these responses develop and vary when the behavioral significance of stimuli changes during different stages of learning. Impulses from DA neurons were recorded with movable microelectrodes from areas A8, A9, and A10 in two awake monkeys during the successive acquisition of two behavioral tasks. Impulses of DA neurons were distinguished from other neurons by their long duration (1.8-5.0 ms) and low spontaneous frequency (0.5-7.0 imp/s). 2. In the first task, animals learned to reach in a small box in front of them when it opened visibly and audibly. Before conditioning, DA neurons were activated the first few times that the empty box opened and animals reacted with saccadic eye movements. Neuronal and behavioral responses disappeared on repeated stimulus presentation. Thus neuronal responses were related to the novelty of an unexpected stimulus eliciting orienting behavior. 3. Subsequently, the box contained a small morsel of apple in one out of six trials. Animals reacted with ocular saccades to nearly every box opening and reached out when the morsel was present. One-third of 49 neurons were phasically activated by every door opening. The response was stronger when food was present. Thus DA neurons responded simultaneously to the sight of primary food reward and to the conditioned stimulus associated with reward. 4. When the box contained a morsel of apple on every trial, animals regularly reacted with target-directed eye and arm movements, and the majority of 76 DA neurons responded to door opening. The same neurons lacked responses to a light not associated with task performance that was illuminated at the position of the food box in alternate sessions, thus demonstrating specificity for the behavioral significance of stimuli. 5. The second task employed the operant conditioning of a reaction time situation in which animals reached from a resting key toward a lever when a small light was illuminated. DA neurons lacked responses to the unconditioned light. During task acquisition lasting 2-3 days, one-half of 25 DA neurons were phasically activated when a drop of liquid reward was delivered for reinforcing the reaching movement. In contrast, neurons were not activated when reward was delivered at regular intervals (2.5-3.5 s) but a task was not performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex in the rat produces events in midbrain dopaminergic neurons which resemble natural bursts, and which are closely time-locked to the stimulation, albeit with a very long latency. As a consequence, we have previously argued that such bursts are polysynaptically generated via more proximal excitatory amino acidergic afferents, arising, for example, from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. In the present study, single-pulse electrical stimulation applied to this nucleus (and other sites in the rostral pons) was found to elicit responses in the majority of substantia nigra (A9) dopaminergic neurons. Responses usually consisted of long-latency, long-duration excitations or inhibition-excitations. Thirty-seven percent of responses (currents combined) elicited by stimulation of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus contained time-locked bursts, the bursts being embedded in the long-duration excitatory phases of excitation and inhibition-excitation responses. Stimulation sites located within 0.5 mm of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus were also effective at eliciting time-locked bursts (although less so than sites located in the nucleus itself), whereas more distal sites were virtually ineffective. For responses containing time-locked bursts, a higher percentage of stimulations produced a burst when the response was elicited from within the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus than when it was elicited from outside: the bursts themselves having a very long latency (median of 96.2 ms; shorter than that of medial prefrontal cortex-induced bursts). Finally, although there was no difference in the distribution within the substantia nigra pars compacta of cells which exhibited time-locked bursting and those which did not, stimulation-induced bursts were elicited more frequently in dopaminergic neurons which were classified as "bursting" on the basis of their basal activity. The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus appears to be a critical locus in the rostral pons for the elicitation of time-locked bursts in A9 dopaminergic neurons. Since time-locked bursts were more often elicited from cells which exhibited bursting under basal conditions, this suggests that rostral pontine sites, in particular the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, may play a role in the natural burst activity of dopaminergic neurons. Given that bursts in dopaminergic neurons are generated in response to primary and secondary reinforcers, the projection from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus could be one means by which motivationally relevant information (arising, for example, from the medial prefrontal cortex) reaches these cells.},

  Abstract                 = {The neural processes that underlie the functional emergence of human cognitive functions, particularly those associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), are of growing interest to developmental psychologists and neuroscientists. Specifically, working memory functions have been correlated with PFC activity in nonhuman primates and adult humans but have not been extensively studied in children. We examined the developmental emergence of functions involved in working memory through the use of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), a computerized battery of nonverbal visually-presented neuropsychological tests designed to dissociate frontal from temporal lobe behavioral functions. Participants were normal children, aged 4-8 (n = 181) and a small group of young adults (n = 24) who completed measures of Spatial Memory Span, Spatial Working Memory, the Tower of London planning task, Visual Pattern and Spatial Recognition tasks, and a Set-Shifting task. Findings indicate a general age-related progression in ability levels on frontal lobe tasks, with 4-year-olds performing worse than 5- to 7-year-olds on all measures. Eight-year-olds are superior to younger children in their ability to solve complex problems but have not yet reached adult levels of performance on the most difficult items of the Tower of London and Spatial Working Memory tasks. We conclude that the development of working memory functions proceeds dimensionally, starting with refinement of basic perceptual and sensorimotor functions and culminating with the physiological maturation of widespread neural networks that integrate complex processing demands inherent to working memory tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Short-term memory storage can be divided into separate subsystems for verbal information and visual information, and recent studies have begun to delineate the neural substrates of these working-memory systems. Although the verbal storage system has been well characterized, the storage capacity of visual working memory has not yet been established for simple, suprathreshold features or for conjunctions of features. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to retain information about only four colours or orientations in visual working memory at one time. However, it is also possible to retain both the colour and the orientation of four objects, indicating that visual working memory stores integrated objects rather than individual features. Indeed, objects defined by a conjunction of four features can be retained in working memory just as well as single-feature objects, allowing sixteen individual features to be retained when distributed across four objects. Thus, the capacity of visual working memory must be understood in terms of integrated objects rather than individual features, which places significant constraints on cognitive and neurobiological models of the temporary storage of visual information.},

Four rats received multiple consecutive sessions with both low and high levels of brain stimulation reward (BSR). Rats paused longer and had later start times during sessions when their responses were reinforced with low-magnitude BSR. When estimated by a symmetric Gaussian function, peak times also were earlier; when estimated by a better-fitting asymmetric Gaussian function or by analyzing individual trials, however, these peak-time changes were determined to reflect a mixture of large effects of BSR on start times and no effect on stop times. These results pose a significant dilemma for three major theories of timing (SET, MTS, and BeT), which all predict no effects for chronic manipulations of reinforcer magnitude. We conclude that increased reinforcer magnitude influences timing in two ways: through larger immediate after-effects that delay responding and through anticipatory effects that elicit earlier responding.},

  Abstract                 = {The phasic firing of dopamine neurons has been theorized to encode a reward-prediction error as formalized by the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm in reinforcement learning. Most TD models of dopamine have assumed a stimulus representation, known as the complete serial compound, in which each moment in a trial is distinctly represented. We introduce a more realistic temporal stimulus representation for the TD model. In our model, all external stimuli, including rewards, spawn a series of internal microstimuli, which grow weaker and more diffuse over time. These microstimuli are used by the TD learning algorithm to generate predictions of future reward. This new stimulus representation injects temporal generalization into the TD model and enhances correspondence between model and data in several experiments, including those when rewards are omitted or received early. This improved fit mostly derives from the absence of large negative errors in the new model, suggesting that dopamine alone can encode the full range of TD errors in these situations.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals readily learn the timing between salient events. They can even adapt their timed responding to rapidly changing intervals, sometimes as quickly as a single trial. Recently, drift-diffusion models—widely used to model response times in decision making—have been extended with new learning rules that allow them to accommodate steady-state interval timing, including scalar timing and timescale invariance. These time-adaptive drift-diffusion models (TDDMs) work by accumulating evidence of elapsing time through their drift rate, thereby encoding the to-be-timed interval. One outstanding challenge for these models lies in the dynamics of interval timing—when the to-be-timed intervals are non-stationary. On these schedules, animals often fail to exhibit strict timescale invariance, as expected by the TDDMs and most other timing models. Here, we introduce a simple extension to these TDDMs, where the response threshold is a linear function of the observed event rate. This new model compares favorably against the basic TDDMs and the multiple-time-scale (MTS) habituation model when evaluated against three published datasets on timing dynamics in pigeons. Our results suggest that the threshold for triggering responding in interval timing changes as a function of recent intervals. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: SQAB 2012.},

Here we demonstrate that visual stimulation increases DA activity as measured by in vivo microdialysis in the occipital, but not in the temporal cortex of freely moving rats. Auditory stimulation neither acutely affected DA in the occipital nor in the temporal cortex. A pharmacological challenge with cocaine (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg; i.p.) increased DA levels in both areas dose-dependently. These data suggest that DA might play a role in visual processing selectively in the occipital cortex. Furthermore, the results indicate that DA in both regions may contribute to cocaine's behavioral effects.},

  Abstract                 = {In most neural network models, synapses are treated as static weights that change only with the slow time scales of learning. It is well known, however, that synapses are highly dynamic and show use-dependent plasticity over a wide range of time scales. Moreover, synaptic transmission is an inherently stochastic process: a spike arriving at a presynaptic terminal triggers the release of a vesicle of neurotransmitter from a release site with a probability that can be much less than one. We consider a simple model for dynamic stochastic synapses that can easily be integrated into common models for networks of integrate-and-fire neurons (spiking neurons). The parameters of this model have direct interpretations in terms of synaptic physiology. We investigate the consequences of the model for computing with individual spikes and demonstrate through rigorous theoretical results that the computational power of the network is increased through the use of dynamic synapses.},

  Abstract                 = {The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) constitutes a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia where the final stage of information processing within this system takes place. In this study, using juxtacellular labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction methods, we investigated the spatial organization of the intranigral innervation provided by single GABAergic projection neurons from the sensory-motor subdivision of the rat SNR. Confirming previous observations, most labeled SNR cells were found to possess a local axonal network innervating the pars reticulata and pars compacta (SNC). Within the SNR, axons of these cells were distributed along curved laminas enveloping a dorsolaterally located core, thus mostly respecting the onion-like compartmentalization of this nucleus. Although the axonal projection field mostly remained confined to the dendritic field of the parent neuron, it usually extended beyond its limits in caudal, lateral, and/or dorsal directions. Because SNR cells are GABAergic, this pattern of axonal projection suggests the existence of lateral inhibitory interactions between neurons belonging to the same as well as to adjacent functional subdivisions. Axonal projections of SNR cells to the SNC formed longitudinal bands. These bands partly occupied the SNC region projecting to the striatal sector from which parent SNR cells receive their afferents. These data indicate that SNR cells contribute to an indirect nigrostriatal loop circuit through which the striatum could upregulate its level of dopaminergic transmission via a disinhibition of nigrostriatal neurons. Spatial relationships between elements of this indirect nigrostriatonigral circuit indicate that this circuit operates in both a closed and open loop manner.},

Here, we review recent electrophysiological studies indicating that neurons in the lateral amygdala encode aversive memories during the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Studies that combine unit recording with brain lesions and pharmacological inactivation provide evidence that the lateral amygdala is a crucial locus of fear memory. Extinction of fear memory reduces associative plasticity in the lateral amygdala and involves the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Understanding the signalling of aversive memory by amygdala neurons opens new avenues for research into the neural systems that support fear behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {The nature of information stemming from a single neuron and conveyed simultaneously to several hundred target neurons is not known. Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different pre-postsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of frequency-dependent synapses revealed supra-linear, linear, and sub-linear signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by selective synaptic modifications.},

Such characteristics are reflected in their functional properties and the behaviors in which they are involved, ranging from motor to cognitive functions, and the regulation of brain states. A clue to understand this functional versatility arises from the internal organization of the PPN. Thus, two main areas of the PPN have been described, the rostral and the caudal, which display remarkable differences in terms of the distribution of neurons with similar phenotype and the projections that originate from them. Here we review these differences with the premise that in order to understand the function of the PPN it is necessary to understand its intricate connectivity. We support the case that the PPN should not be considered as a homogeneous structure and conclude that the differences between rostral and caudal PPN, along with their intrinsic connectivity, may underlie the basis of its complexity.},

This gap may be explained by the difficulty to find in humans suitable appetitive stimuli that can elicit physiological responses similar to those elicited by aversive stimuli. To help remedy this gap, we review the literature on conditioning, with emphasis on appetitive conditioning. This review comprises three parts. First, we examine the different forms of conditioning. Second, we review the neural basis of appetitive conditioning, particularly from a functional neuroimaging perspective. And third, we demonstrate how perturbations in processes involved in appetitive conditioning can contribute to implicated psychopathologies and suggest neurobiological models underlying these pathologies. The ultimate goal of this review is to stimulate new avenues of research that have direct links to molecular biology, and thus could prove to be invaluable to progress in the understanding and treatment of psychiatric disabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. For example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by Gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. This superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. Various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. These models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. A review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. The neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. The hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [R.C. Miall, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 359–371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. By implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {The axonal arbors of single nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons were visualized with a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein in rat brain. All eight reconstructed tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons possessed widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum. All of them emitted very little axon collateral arborization outside of the striatum except for tiny arborization in the external pallidum. The striatal axonal bush of each reconstructed dopaminergic neuron covered 0.45-5.7\% (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 1.5\%) of the total volume of the neostriatum. Furthermore, all the dopaminergic neurons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum, although each neuron's arborization tended to favor one of these compartments. Our findings demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra can broadcast a dopamine signal and exert strong influence over a large number of striatal neurons. This divergent signaling should be a key to the function of the nigrostriatal system in dopamine-based learning and suggests that neurodegeneration of individual nigral neurons can affect multiple neurons in the striatum. Thus, these results would also contribute to understanding the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related syndromes.},

  Abstract                 = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by reward or sensory stimuli predicting reward. These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward-predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopamine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar anatomical difference was observed for their responses to actual airpuffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners.},

  Abstract                 = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are key components of the brain's reward system, which is thought to guide reward-seeking behaviours. Although recent studies have shown how dopamine neurons respond to rewards and sensory stimuli predicting reward, it is unclear which parts of the brain provide dopamine neurons with signals necessary for these actions. Here we show that the primate lateral habenula, part of the structure called the epithalamus, is a major candidate for a source of negative reward-related signals in dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of habenula neurons and dopamine neurons while rhesus monkeys were performing a visually guided saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes. Many habenula neurons were excited by a no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by a reward-predicting target. In contrast, dopamine neurons were excited and inhibited by reward-predicting and no-reward-predicting targets, respectively. Each time the rewarded and unrewarded positions were reversed, both habenula and dopamine neurons reversed their responses as the bias in saccade latency reversed. In unrewarded trials, the excitation of habenula neurons started earlier than the inhibition of dopamine neurons. Furthermore, weak electrical stimulation of the lateral habenula elicited strong inhibitions in dopamine neurons. These results suggest that the inhibitory input from the lateral habenula plays an important role in determining the reward-related activity of dopamine neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {The projection from the thalamic centre médian-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex to the caudate nucleus and putamen forms a massive striatal input system in primates. We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53\%) and/or auditory beep (61\%) or click (91\%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value.},

These variables have not been dissociated in previous imaging work in humans, thus conflating possible interpretations of the kinds of expectation errors driving the measured brain responses. Using a passive conditioning task and fMRI in human subjects, we show that positive and negative prediction errors in reward delivery time correlate with BOLD changes in human striatum, with the strongest activation lateralized to the left putamen. For the negative prediction error, the brain response was elicited by expectations only and not by stimuli presented directly; that is, we measured the brain response to nothing delivered (juice expected but not delivered) contrasted with nothing delivered (nothing expected).},

  Abstract                 = {Slices of sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortex from guinea pigs were maintained in vitro and bathed in a normal physiological medium. Electrophysiological properties of neurons were assessed with intracellular recording techniques. Some neurons were identified morphologically by intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH. Three distinct neuronal classes of electrophysiological behavior were observed; these were termed regular spiking, bursting, and fast spiking. The physiological properties of neurons from sensorimotor and anterior cingulate areas did not differ significantly. Regular-spiking cells were characterized by action potentials with a mean duration of 0.80 ms at one-half amplitude, a ratio of maximum rate of spike rise to maximum rate of fall of 4.12, and a prominent afterhyperpolarization following a train of spikes. The primary slope of initial spike frequency versus injected current intensity was 241 Hz/nA. During prolonged suprathreshold current pulses the frequency of firing adapted strongly. When local synaptic pathways were activated, all cells were transiently excited and then strongly inhibited. Bursting cells were distinguished by their ability to generate endogenous, all-or-none bursts of three to five action potentials. Their properties were otherwise very similar to regular-spiking cells. The ability to generate a burst was eliminated when the membrane was depolarized to near the firing threshold with tonic current. By contrast, hyperpolarization of regular-spiking (i.e., nonbursting) cells did not uncover latent bursting tendencies. The action potentials of fast-spiking cells were much briefer (mean of 0.32 ms) than those of the other cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {When exposed to pairings of a visual stimulus with food delivery, rats normally acquire both conditioned orienting responses directed toward the visual stimulus and conditioned food-related responses. Consistent with the results of previous lesion studies, reversible inactivation of amygdala central nucleus function before each conditioning session prevented the acquisition of conditioned orienting responses, whereas food-related behaviors were acquired normally. By contrast, neither inactivation nor neurotoxic lesions of central nucleus affected the expression of previously acquired conditioned orienting responses. Thus, the central nucleus is apparently not critical to the maintenance of information required for conditioned orienting, but instead is necessary for memory storage elsewhere. Specialized roles for components of a circuit for conditioned orienting, which includes the central nucleus, the substantia nigra, and dorsolateral striatum, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The encoding of reward-predictive stimuli by neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) depends on integrated synaptic activity from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) afferent inputs. In a previous study, we found that single electrical stimulation pulses applied to the BLA facilitate mPFC-evoked spiking in NAcc neurons in a timing-dependent manner, presumably by a fast glutamatergic mechanism. In the present study, the ability of repetitive BLA activation to modulate synaptic inputs to NAcc neurons through dopamine- or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent mechanisms is characterized. NAcc neurons receiving excitatory input from both mPFC and BLA were recorded in urethane-anesthetized rats. Train stimulation of the BLA depressed mPFC-evoked spiking in these neurons. This was not attributable to mechanisms involving NMDA or dopamine D1, D2, D3 or D5 receptors, since blockade of these receptors did not affect the BLA-mediated depression. BLA-mediated depression was only evident when the BLA stimulation evoked spikes in the recorded neuron; thus, depolarization of the recorded neuron may be critical for this effect. The ability of the BLA to suppress mPFC-to-NAcc signaling may be a mechanism by which normal or pathologically heightened emotional states disrupt goal-directed behavior in favor of emotionally-driven responses.},

The question remains as to how this selection of relevant items to be remembered is accomplished. Here we show that activity in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia preceded the filtering of irrelevant information and that activity, particularly in the globus pallidus, predicted the extent to which only relevant information is stored. The preceding frontal and basal ganglia activity were also associated with inter-individual differences in working memory capacity. These findings reveal a mechanism by which frontal and basal ganglia activity exerts attentional control over access to working memory storage in the parietal cortex in humans, and makes an important contribution to inter-individual differences in working memory capacity.},

Projections from the dopamine-containing cells of the ventral mesencephalon to the prefrontal cortex are also critical for these cognitive abilities. It is unclear, however, whether dopamine axons innervate the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in primates. In order to address this question, we examined the distribution of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus of macaque monkeys. Labeled axons were distributed quite heterogeneously in this nucleus, and did not strictly follow cytoarchitectonic subdivision boundaries. The ventral and lateral portions of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, which include parts of the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions, had the highest density of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons. In contrast, the dorsomedial portion, which included primarily the magnocellular subdivision, had the lowest density of labeled axons. In both lightly and densely innervated portions of the nucleus, small, dense clusters of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons were present. Axons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase were distributed in a pattern very similar to that of dopamine transporter-labeled axons. In contrast, noradrenergic axons, as revealed by dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity, were present in higher density and were more evenly distributed throughout the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. This dopamine innervation of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus reveals another possible anatomical substrate through which dopamine may influence the cognitive functions mediated by thalamo-prefrontal circuitry.},

The PPN provides an interface for the basal ganglia to influence sleep and waking, and the two structures are similarly implicated in learning, reward and other cognitive functions. Perturbations of basal ganglia activity have consequences for the PPN and vice versa, exemplified by their interdependencies in motor function and Parkinson's disease. Thus, close anatomical and physiological links between the PPN and basal ganglia make it increasingly difficult to consider the two as separate functional entities.},

Combined (i.e., rhinal cortex) lesions yielded a striking impairment on this task, one almost as severe as that seen after combined amygdalohippocampal removals that included some of this subjacent cortex (Mishkin, 1978; Murray and Mishkin, 1984). Ablations of the perirhinal cortex alone produced a deficit nearly as severe as that found after rhinal cortex lesions, whereas ablations of the entorhinal cortex alone produced only a mild deficit. Contrary to the conclusion from an earlier study (Murray and Mishkin, 1986), the present results demonstrate not only that damage limited to the rhinal cortex is sufficient to produce a severe loss in visual recognition, but also that such damage leads to a far greater loss than damage to any other single structure in the medial part of the temporal lobe.},

All of these prefrontal areas were found to be targets of basal-ganglia output that originated in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and/or the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNpr). Approximately one-third of the total volume of these nuclei was directed toward prefrontal cortex, a volume comparable to that directed at the cortical motor areas. The origins of the outputs to different prefrontal areas were topographically organized. Different portions of SNpr (the rostral and caudal thirds) projected to areas 9m and 12l. Similarly, different output nuclei (GPi and SNpr) projected to adjacent portions of the same cytoarchitectonic field (46d and 46v). Furthermore, the outputs to prefrontal areas were segregated from those to motor areas of cortex. Thus, basal-ganglia outputs to prefrontal cortex are both extensive and topographically organized, forming a rich anatomical substrate for basal-ganglia influences on the cognitive operations of the frontal lobe.},

Of these cortical areas, only the frontal lobe is thought to be the target of basal ganglia output. One of the cortical regions that is a source of input to the basal ganglia is area TE, in inferotemporal cortex. This cortical area is thought to be critically involved in the recognition and discrimination of visual objects. Using retrograde transneuronal transport of herpes simplex virus type 1, we have found that one of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, projects via the thalamus to TE. Thus, TE is not only a source of input to the basal ganglia, but also is a target of basal ganglia output. This result implies that the output of the basal ganglia influences higher order aspects of visual processing. In addition, we propose that dysfunction of the basal ganglia loop with TE leads to alterations in visual perception, including visual hallucinations.},

  Abstract                 = {The prefrontal cortex has long been suspected to play an important role in cognitive control, in the ability to orchestrate thought and action in accordance with internal goals. Its neural basis, however, has remained a mystery. Here, we propose that cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represent goals and the means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task. We review neurophysiological, neurobiological, neuroimaging, and computational studies that support this theory and discuss its implications as well as further issues to be addressed},

  Abstract                 = {Inferior temporal (IT) cortex of primates is known to play an important role in visual memory. Previous studies of IT neurons during performance of working memory tasks have found modulation of responses when a current stimulus matched an item in memory; however, this effect was lost if other stimuli intervened in the retention interval. To examine how IT cortex retains memories while new stimuli are activating the cells, we recorded from IT neurons while monkeys performed a delayed matching-to-sample task, with multiple intervening items between the sample and matching test stimulus. About half of the cells responded differently to a test stimulus if it matched the sample, and this difference was maintained following intervening stimuli. For most of the affected cells, the responses to matching stimuli were suppressed; however, for a few cells the opposite effect was seen. Temporal contiguity alone could not explain the results, as there was no modulation of responses when a stimulus on one trial was repeated on the next trial. Thus, an active reset mechanism appears to restrict the memory comparison to just the stimuli presented within a trial. The suppressive effects appear to be generated within or before IT cortex since the suppression of response to matching stimuli began almost immediately with the onset of the visual response. The memory of the sample stimulus affected not only the responses to matching stimuli but also those to nonmatching stimuli. There was suggestive evidence that the more similar a nonmatching stimulus to the sample, the more the response was suppressed. About a quarter of the cells showed stimulus-selective activity in the delay interval following the sample. However, this activity appeared to be eliminated by intervening stimuli. Thus, it is unlikely that delay-interval activity in IT contributed to the performance of this particular version of delayed matching to sample. To determine how much information about the match-nonmatch status of the stimulus was conveyed by individual neurons, we analyzed the responses with discriminant analysis. The responses of an individual IT neuron could be used to classify a stimulus as matching or nonmatching on about 60\% of the trials. To achieve the same performance as the animal would require averaging the responses of a minimum of 25 IT neurons. There was no evidence that mnemonic information was carried by temporal variations in the spike trains. By contrast, there was a modest amount of temporal variation in sensory responses to different visual stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {An important issue of recent neuroscientific research is to understand the functional role of the phasic release of dopamine in the striatum, and in particular its relation to reinforcement learning. The literature is split between two alternative hypotheses: one considers phasic dopamine as a reward prediction error similar to the computational TD-error, whose function is to guide an animal to maximize future rewards; the other holds that phasic dopamine is a sensory prediction error signal that lets the animal discover and acquire novel actions. In this paper we propose an original hypothesis that integrates these two contrasting positions: according to our view phasic dopamine represents a TD-like reinforcement prediction error learning signal determined by both unexpected changes in the environment (temporary, intrinsic reinforcements) and biological rewards (permanent, extrinsic reinforcements). Accordingly, dopamine plays the functional role of driving both the discovery and acquisition of novel actions and the maximization of future rewards. To validate our hypothesis we perform a series of experiments with a simulated robotic system that has to learn different skills in order to get rewards. We compare different versions of the system in which we vary the composition of the learning signal. The results show that only the system reinforced by both extrinsic and intrinsic reinforcements is able to reach high performance in sufficiently complex conditions.},

Four days after rabies injections into these MI regions, neuronal labeling occurred in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) through the cortico-basal ganglia loop circuits. In the striatum, two distinct sets of the labeling were observed: one in the dorsal putamen, and the other in the ventral striatum (ventromedial putamen and nucleus accumbens). The dorsal striatal labeling was somatotopically arranged and its distribution pattern was in good accordance with that of the corticostriatal inputs, such that the hindlimb, orofacial, or forelimb area was located in the dorsal, ventral, or intermediate zone of the putamen, respectively. The distribution pattern of the ventral striatal labeling was essentially the same in all cases. In the STN, the somatotopic arrangement of labeled neurons was in register with that of corticosubthalamic inputs. The present results suggest that the cortico-basal ganglia motor circuits involving the dorsal putamen and the STN may constitute separate closed loops based on the somatotopy, while the ventral striatum provides common multisynaptic projections to all body-part representations in the MI.},

  Abstract                 = {To study the roles of the perirhinal cortex (PRh) and temporal cortex (area TE) in stimulus-reward associations, we recorded spike activities of cells from PRh and TE in two monkeys performing a visually cued go/no-go task. Each visual cue indicated the required motor action as well as the availability of reward after correct completion of the trial. Eighty object images were divided into four groups, each of which was assigned to one of four motor-reward conditions. The monkeys either had to release a lever (go response) or keep pressing it (no-go response), depending on the cue. Each of the go and no-go trials could be either a rewarded or unrewarded trial. A liquid reward was provided after correct responses in rewarded trials, whereas correct responses were acknowledged only by audiovisual feedback in unrewarded trials. Several measures of the monkeys' behavior indicated that the monkeys correctly anticipated the reward availability in each trial. The dependence of neuronal activity on the reward condition was examined by comparing mean discharges to each of the 40 rewarded stimuli with those to each of the 40 unrewarded stimuli. Many cells in both areas showed significant reward dependence in their responses to the visual cues, and this was not likely attributable to differences in behavior across conditions because the variations in neuronal activity were not correlated with trial-by-trial variations in latency of go responses or anticipatory sucking strength. These results suggest the involvement of PRh and TE in associating visual stimuli with reward outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) following focal afferent stimulation were recorded from patch-clamped magnocellular neurones in a thin-slice preparation of the rat basal forebrain. Evoked EPSCs had a mean decay time constant of 3.81 +/- 0.09 ms and were reversibly blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 5 microM). 2. Bath-applied dopamine (DA) reduced evoked EPSC amplitude by up to 54.2 +/- 2.3\% with an IC50 of 19.9 microM in normal Krebs solution (2.5 mM Ca2+, 1.2 mM Mg2+) without effect on postsynaptic holding current. 3. DA (30 microM) reduced the mean frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs recorded in 0.5 microM tetrodotoxin without affecting their mean amplitude, rise time or decay time constant. This effect was diminished by 100 microM Cd2+. 4. The effect of DA on evoked EPSCs was mimicked by the D1-like receptor agonist, SKF 81297 (IC50 25.6 microM), but not by the D2-like receptor agonist R(-)-TNPA (30 microM) or (-)-quinpirole (30 microM), and was antagonized by the D1-like receptor antagonist R(+)-SCH 23390 (estimated dissociation constant KB = 1.7 microM) but not by the D2-like receptor antagonist S(-)-eticlopride (10 microM). 5. Forskolin (10 microM) reduced evoked EPSCs to approximately 60\% of the control amplitude, and occluded the effect of subsequent application of DA. 6. These results suggest that glutamatergic afferents to magnocellular basal forebrain neurones possess presynaptic D1-like DA receptors, and that activation of these receptors reduces excitatory glutamatergic transmission, probably via an adenylyl cyclase-dependent pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {Recordings from cells in the associative cortex of monkeys performing visual working memory tasks link persistent neuronal activity, long-term memory and associative memory. In particular, delayed pair-associate tasks have revealed neuronal correlates of long-term memory of associations between stimuli. Here, a recurrent cortical network model with Hebbian plastic synapses is subjected to the pair-associate protocol. In a first stage, learning leads to the appearance of delay activity, representing individual images ('retrospective' activity). As learning proceeds, the same learning mechanism uses retrospective delay activity together with choice stimulus activity to potentiate synapses connecting neural populations representing associated images. As a result, the neural population corresponding to the pair-associate of the image presented is activated prior to its visual stimulation ('prospective' activity). The probability of appearance of prospective activity is governed by the strength of the inter-population connections, which in turn depends on the frequency of pairings during training. The time course of the transitions from retrospective to prospective activity during the delay period is found to depend on the fraction of slow, N-methyl-d-aspartate-like receptors at excitatory synapses. For fast recurrent excitation, transitions are abrupt; slow recurrent excitation renders transitions gradual. Both scenarios lead to a gradual rise of delay activity when averaged over many trials, because of the stochastic nature of the transitions. The model reproduces most of the neuro-physiological data obtained during such tasks, makes experimentally testable predictions and demonstrates how persistent activity (working memory) brings about the learning of long-term associations.},

We present a model for how such errors could be constructed in a real brain that is consistent with physiological results for a subset of dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area and surrounding dopaminergic neurons. The theory also makes testable predictions about human choice behavior on a simple decision-making task. Furthermore, we show that, through a simple influence on synaptic plasticity, fluctuations in dopamine release can act to change the predictions in an appropriate manner.},

  Abstract                 = {Distinctive neuronal activities related to visual stimulus-stimulus association have been found in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys. They provide an important clue to elucidating the memory mechanisms of the brain, but do not accord with existing neural network models. In the present paper, we clarify the computational principle required for reproducing the empirical data and construct a biologically feasible model that learns and performs a delayed pair-association task. This model is composed of two neural networks, association network N1 and trainer network N2, and pair-association memories are formed by their interactions. Specifically, N2 receives the output of N1 in addition to an external input, and sends a learning signal back to N1; this signal works as a guide for shifts in output pattern or state transitions of N1, and memory traces are engraved along its path, so that a trajectory attractor connecting from the cue-coding to the target-coding state is formed in N1. Computer simulation shows that the model not only distinguishes the target in the task, but also explains the activity of the IT neurons very well. It is reasonable to presume that N1 and N2 correspond to area TE and the rhinal cortex, respectively; based on this theory, we explain some physiological findings on learning and memory, and also make several predictions.},

In addition, the onset of responding measured by the number of reinforcers to a criterion or by a quantitatively identified change point also reflected US magnitude. Two aversive conditioning experiments also found that the amount and onset of freezing were related to footshock intensity. All experiments identified a trial at which responding increased abruptly in individual subjects. However, the point where the increase occurred was earlier with larger USs.},

Within this scheme, the subthreshold dynamics of a wide class of integrate-and-fire-type neuron models can be integrated exactly from one grid point to the next. However, the loss in accuracy caused by restricting spike times to the grid can have undesirable consequences, which has led to interest in interpolating spike times between the grid points to retrieve an adequate representation of network dynamics. We demonstrate that the exact integration scheme can be combined naturally with off-grid spike events found by interpolation. We show that by exploiting the existence of a minimal synaptic propagation delay, the need for a central event queue is removed, so that the precision of event-driven simulation on the level of single neurons is combined with the efficiency of time-driven global scheduling. Further, for neuron models with linear subthreshold dynamics, even local event queuing can be avoided, resulting in much greater efficiency on the single-neuron level. These ideas are exemplified by two implementations of a widely used neuron model. We present a measure for the efficiency of network simulations in terms of their integration error and show that for a wide range of input spike rates, the novel techniques we present are both more accurate and faster than standard techniques.},

We apply the model to fear conditioning, in which animals learn physiological (e.g. heart rate) and behavioral (e.g. freezing) responses to stimuli that have been paired with a highly aversive event (e.g. electrical shock). The key feature of our model is that learning of these conditioned responses in the central nucleus of the amygdala is modulated by two separate processes, one from basolateral amygdala and signaling a positive prediction error, and one from the vmPFC, via the intercalated cells of the amygdala, and signaling a negative prediction error. In addition, we propose that hippocampal input to both vmPFC and basolateral amygdala is essential for contextual modulation of fear acquisition and extinction. The model is sufficient to account for a body of data from various animal fear conditioning paradigms, including acquisition, extinction, reacquisition, and context specificity effects. Consistent with studies on lesioned animals, our model shows that damage to the vmPFC impairs extinction, while damage to the hippocampus impairs extinction in a different context (e.g., a different conditioning chamber from that used in initial training in animal experiments). We also discuss model limitations and predictions, including the effects of number of training trials on fear conditioning.},

  Abstract                 = {A recurrent-network model provides a unified account of the hippocampal region in mediating the representation of temporal information in classical eyeblink conditioning. Much empirical research is consistent with a general conclusion that delay conditioning (in which the conditioned stimulus CS and unconditioned stimulus US overlap and co-terminate) is independent of the hippocampal system, while trace conditioning (in which the CS terminates before US onset) depends on the hippocampus. However, recent studies show that, under some circumstances, delay conditioning can be hippocampal-dependent and trace conditioning can be spared following hippocampal lesion. Here, we present an extension of our prior trial-level models of hippocampal function and stimulus representation that can explain these findings within a unified framework. Specifically, the current model includes adaptive recurrent collateral connections that aid in the representation of intra-trial temporal information. With this model, as in our prior models, we argue that the hippocampus is not specialized for conditioned response timing, but rather is a general-purpose system that learns to predict the next state of all stimuli given the current state of variables encoded by activity in recurrent collaterals. As such, the model correctly predicts that hippocampal involvement in classical conditioning should be critical not only when there is an intervening trace interval, but also when there is a long delay between CS onset and US onset. Our model simulates empirical data from many variants of classical conditioning, including delay and trace paradigms in which the length of the CS, the inter-stimulus interval, or the trace interval is varied. Finally, we discuss model limitations, future directions, and several novel empirical predictions of this temporal processing model of hippocampal function and learning.},

For example, removal of the perirhinal cortex yields severe impairments on tests of stimulus recognition and stimulus-stimulus association. There is considerable disagreement, however, about the most accurate way to characterize the function of the perirhinal cortex; some views emphasize a role in perception whereas others posit a role exclusively in declarative memory. In this article, we review recent findings from anatomical, physiological and ablation studies in monkeys, and discuss related findings obtained in humans, in an attempt to identify not only the cognitive functions of the perirhinal cortex, but also the implications of these findings for theoretical views concerning the organization of memory.},

Studies of neuronal activity in the monkey amygdala and of autonomic responses mediated by the monkey amygdala show that, contrary to a widely held view, the amygdala is just as important for processing positive reward and reinforcement as it is for negative. In addition, neuropsychological studies reveal that the amygdala is essential for only a fraction of what might be considered 'stimulus-reward processing', and that the neural substrates for emotion and reward are partially nonoverlapping. Finally, evidence suggests that two systems within the amygdala, operating in parallel, enable reward-predicting cues to influence behavior; one mediates a general, arousing effect of reward and the other links the sensory properties of reward to emotion.},

They then received bilateral removals of either the amygdaloid complex and underlying cortex, the hippocampal formation and underlying cortex, or both combined, or they were retained as unoperated controls. After surgery or rest, the monkeys were tested for their retention of the preoperatively learned set of paired associates, as well as for their ability to learn new associations of the same type. Both unoperated controls and hippocampectomized monkeys relearned the preoperatively trained set of paired associates almost immediately. By contrast, monkeys with amygdala removals were moderately retarded in relearning, and monkeys with combined amygdala and hippocampal ablations were severely retarded. When confronted with new sets of visual stimuli, monkeys with amygdala removals or hippocampal removals learned new sets of paired associates at the same rate as the controls, whereas monkeys with the combined ablation were again profoundly retarded. Only one monkey with the combined lesion was able to learn new stimulus-stimulus associations to criterion, and then only after extensive training, despite the ability of all three animals in this group to perform delayed matching-to-sample with the same stimuli and the same intraatrial delays as those used in the paired associate task. At the end of the main experiment, two of the unoperated controls received bilateral ablations of the rhinal cortex. These monkeys showed the same level of difficulty in learning new paired associates as the animals in the main experiment that had received the combined amygdala plus hippocampal ablations. The results implicate the medial temporal lobe, and particularly the rhinal cortex, in the formation of stimulus-stimulus associative memories.},

We examined the activity of neurons in the globus pallidus (GP) while monkeys (n = 2) performed sequential pointing movements under two task conditions: visually guided (TRACK task) and remembered (REM task). 2. Almost two-thirds of the task-related neurons in GP (155/236) were considered task dependent because they displayed exclusive or enhanced (greater than +/- 50\%) changes in activity for one of the two task conditions. 3. More than 65\% of the task-dependent neurons were termed REM neurons because they either displayed changes in activity that occurred only during the REM task or displayed changes that were more pronounced (greater than +/- 50\%) during the REM task than during the TRACK task. 4. Nearly half of the REM neurons in GP displayed changes in activity that were limited to a single phase of the REM task (i.e., phase specific). Phase-specific neurons varied in the extent to which their activity depended on the particular sequence of movements performed. Some displayed a change in activity for all of the eight different movement sequences. Others displayed a change in activity during only one of the eight different sequences (i.e., phase and sequence specific). 5. We speculate that an ensemble of GP neurons with phase-specific responses could be used to encode the detailed spatio-temporal characteristics of a sequential movement. In this way, GP neurons would provide part of the neural substrate that solves the "serial order of motor behavior problem".},

Some of these loops are believed to be responsible for saccade target selection. We study here how the very specific structural relationships of these saccadic loops can affect the ability of learning spatial and feature-based tasks. We propose a model of saccade generation with reinforcement learning capabilities based on our previous BG and superior colliculus models. It is structured around the interactions of two parallel cortico-basal loops and one tecto-basal loop. The two cortical loops separately deal with spatial and non-spatial information to select targets in a concurrent way. The subcortical loop is used to make the final target selection leading to the production of the saccade. These different loops may work in concert or disturb each other regarding reward maximization. Interactions between these loops and their learning capabilities are tested on different saccade tasks. The results show the ability of this model to correctly learn basic target selection based on different criteria (spatial or not). Moreover the model reproduces and explains training dependent express saccades toward targets based on a spatial criterion. Finally, the model predicts that in absence of prefrontal control, the spatial loop should dominate.},

The responses of single neurons in the anterior part of the temporal cortex in monkeys, mainly the temporopolar cortex, area 36, and the most anterior part of area TE of von Bonin and Bailey (1947) (these areas were designated here as the temporal pole), were examined during the performance of a visual recognition memory task. The visual stimulus (sample stimulus) was presented when the monkey pressed a lever. The same sample stimulus was presented one to four times and, thereafter, a new stimulus was presented. The monkeys were trained to discriminate the new stimulus from the sample stimulus and to release the lever in response to the new stimulus. We used colored photographs of natural objects (human faces, monkeys, foods, and non-food objects) as complex visual stimuli or computer-generated two-dimensional shapes (a red square, a green circle, etc.) as simple visual stimuli. 2. In total, the activity of 311 neurons was recorded, and 225 of these responded to at least one visual stimulus. All visually responsive neurons were located in the ventral part of the temporal pole including the banks of the superior temporal sulcus. 3. The relationship between the monkey's eye movements and visual responses was investigated. Visual response properties, such as the number of spikes, onset latency, and response duration, were stable regardless of the monkey's eye positions and movements if the eyes were directed to the display. We also examined the receptive field property of neurons (n = 3). The neurons tested in the temporal pole tended to have a large receptive field (24 x 24 degrees). 4. The neurons tended to respond to different stimuli in different magnitudes. In each case, the maximal responses were elicited by complex, colored photographs, whereas simple, two-dimensional colored shapes elicited little or no responses. In 21\% of the cases (47/225), the magnitude of the maximal response was significantly larger than for any of the other responses. 5. An achromatic version of the stimulus that induced the maximal response was tested in 53 neurons. About 80\% of the neurons (41/53) responded to the achromatic stimulus at a magnitude that was not significantly different from the response to the original stimulus. In 12 neurons, the removal of color did significantly decrease the magnitude of the response. When other colors were tested, 3 of 9 neurons were found to code for color. 6. In 21 of these 53 neurons, a portion (the left-, right-, upper-, or lower-half) of the stimulus was also tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Involvement of rat lateral hypothalamus (LHA) neurons in integration of motivation, reward, and learning processes was studied by recording single-neuron activity during cuetone discrimination, learning behavior to obtain glucose, or electrical rewarding intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the posterior LHA. To relate the activity of an LHA neuron to glucose, ICSS, and anticipatory cues, the same licking task was used to obtain both rewards. Each neuron was tested with rewards alone and then with rewards signaled by cuetone stimuli (CTS), CTS1+ = 1,200 Hz for glucose, CTS2+ = 4,300 Hz for ICSS, and CTS- = 2,800 Hz for no reward. The activity of 318 neurons in the LHA was analyzed. Of these, 212 (66.7\%) responded to one or both rewarding stimuli (glucose, 115; ICSS, 193). Usually, both rewards affected the same neuron in the same direction. Of 96 neurons that responded to both rewards, the responses of 72 (75\%) were similar, i.e., either both excitatory or both inhibitory. When a tone was associated with glucose or ICSS reward, 81 of the 212 neurons that responded to either or both rewards and none of 106 neurons that failed to respond to either reward acquired a response to the respective CTS. Usually, the response to a tone was in the same direction as the reward response. Of 45 neurons that responded to both glucose and CTS1+, 38 (84.4\%) were similar, and of 66 that responded to both ICSS and CTS2+, 47 (71.2\%) were similar. The neural response to a tone was acquired rapidly after licking behavior was learned and was extinguished equally rapidly before licking stopped in extinction. The latency of the neural response to CTS1+ was 10-150 ms (58.7 +/- 40.9 ms, mean +/- SE, n = 31), and that of the first lick was 100-370 ms (204.8 +/- 59.1 ms, n = 31). The latency of neural responses to CTS2+ was 10-230 ms (68.3 +/- 53.5 ms, n = 33), and that of the first lick was 90-370 ms (212.4 +/- 58.5 ms, n = 33). There was no significant difference between the neural response latencies for the two cue tones nor between the lick latencies for the different rewards. Neurons inhibited by glucose or ICSS reward were distributed widely in the LHA, whereas most excited neurons were in the posterodorsal subarea; fewer were in the anteroventral subarea. Neurons responding to the CTS for glucose or ICSS were found more frequently in the posterior region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Somatotopic organization is a fundamental and key concept to understand how the cortico-basal ganglia loop works. It is also indispensable knowledge to perform stereotaxic surgery for movement disorders. Here I would like to describe the somatotopic organization of the basal ganglia, which consist of the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. Projections from motor cortical regions representing different body parts terminate in different regions of these nuclei. Basal ganglia neurons respond not only to the stimulation of the corresponding regions of the motor cortices, but also to active and passive movements of the corresponding body parts. On the basis of these anatomical and physiological findings, somatotopic organization can be identified in the motor territories of these nuclei in the basal ganglia. In addition, projections from functionally interrelated cortical areas partially converge through the cortico-basal ganglia loop, but nevertheless the somatotopy is still preserved. Disorganized somatotopy may explain, at least in part, the pathophysiology of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia.},

  Abstract                 = {To analyze the organization of corticostriatal motor inputs, we examined the neuronal responses in the putamen (Put) to stimulation in the primary motor cortex (MI) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Stimulating electrodes were chronically implanted in the distal and proximal parts of the forelimb representation of the MI and in the forelimb representation of the SMA in Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata). Stimulation in the MI and SMA evoked orthodromic spike discharges in both phasically active and tonically active Put neurons. The latency of excitation evoked by MI stimulation was shorter than that of excitation evoked by SMA stimulation. Neurons responding exclusively to MI stimulation (MI-recipient neurons) and those responding exclusively to SMA stimulation (SMA-recipient neurons) were distributed predominantly in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial portion of the caudal aspect of the Put, respectively. About 20\% of the recorded neurons responded concurrently to stimulation in both the MI and SMA (MI + SMA-recipient neurons). These neurons were located in the intermediate zone between the MI- and SMA-recipient zones. More than half of the Put neurons responded to sensorimotor stimulation. Movements of the forelimb were readily elicited by microstimulation in the MI-recipient zone, less frequently in the MI + SMA-recipient zone, and rarely in the SMA-recipient zone. More detailed analysis of the somatotopic arrangement based on cortical inputs, sensorimotor responses, and microstimulation-evoked movements revealed that within the MI- and MI + SMA-recipient zones of the Put, neurons representing the distal part of the forelimb were located more ventrally than those representing the proximal part. No such somatotopy was clearly detected in the SMA-recipient zone. The present results indicate that corticostriatal inputs from the forelimb regions of the MI and SMA are largely segregated. On the other hand, convergent inputs from the MI and SMA were noted on single neurons located at the junction between the two input zones. In addition, the corticostriatal inputs from the forelimb region of the MI exhibited a distal to proximal somatotopic organization along the ventrodorsal axis of the Put.},

This ability is especially crucial in the more real-life situations, where relevant items have to be discriminated from irrelevant distracters. Although much work has been done on the brain mechanisms and neural correlates of the enumeration and/or discrimination process, no agreement has been reached yet. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to show the time course of brain activity elicited by a task that involved both enumeration and discrimination at the same time. We found that even though the two processes run to some extent in parallel, discrimination seems to take place mainly in an earlier time window (from 100 ms after the stimulus onset) than enumeration (beyond 200 ms after the stimulus onset). Moreover, electrophysiological evidence based on the N2 and P3 components make it reasonable to argue for the existence of a dichotomy between subitizing (for sets of less than four items) and counting (for sets of four and more items). Source estimation suggests that subitizing and counting, though being distinct brain processes, do recruit similar brain areas.},

In the present study, we compared delay-period activities of the two subdivisions in terms of their signal contents. We recorded single-unit activities from TE and A36 during a delayed pair association task, in which monkeys were required to choose the paired associate of a cue stimulus after a delay period. The stimulus-selective delay-period activities of single neurons were characterized by using partial correlation coefficients of delay-period activities for each cue stimulus with the cue-period responses to that stimulus (cue-holding index, CHI) and with the cue-period responses to its paired associate (pair-recall index, PRI). The delay-period activities of TE neurons preferentially represented the paired associate (PRI, median = 0.54) rather than the cue stimulus itself (CHI, 0.23) (P < 0.001, n = 70), while the delay-period activities of A36 neurons retained both the cue stimulus and its paired associate equivalently (CHI, 0.44; PRI, 0.46) (P = 0.78, n = 38). These results indicate that the signal contents of delay-period activities differ between the two subdivisions: TE mostly represents a sought target that is retrieved from long-term memory, while A36 in addition retains cue-stimulus that is transmitted from earlier visual areas.},

Recent hypotheses propose that the accumbens and its dopamine projection from the midbrain contribute to appetitive behaviors required to obtain reward. However, the specific nature of this contribution is unclear. In contrast, significant advances have been made in understanding the role of the dorsal striatum in action selection and decision making. OBJECTIVE: In order to develop a hypothesis of the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in action selection, the physiology and behavioral pharmacology of the nucleus accumbens are compared to those of the dorsal striatum. HYPOTHESES: Three hypotheses concerning the role of dopamine in these structures are proposed: (1) that dopamine release in the dorsal striatum serves to facilitate the ability to respond appropriately to temporally predictable stimuli (that is, stimuli that are so predictable that animals engage in anticipatory behavior just prior to the stimulus); (2) that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens facilitates the ability to respond to temporally unpredictable stimuli (which require interruption of ongoing behavior); and (3) that accumbens neurons participate in action selection in response to such stimuli by virtue of their direct (monosynaptic inhibitory) and indirect (polysynaptic excitatory) projections to basal ganglia output nuclei.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopamine (DA) acts as a key neurotransmitter in the brain. Numerous studies have shown its regulatory role for motor and limbic functions. However, in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), alterations of executive functions also suggest a role for DA in regulating cognitive functions. Some other diseases, which can also involve DA dysfunction, such as schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, as shown from the ameliorative action of dopaminergic antagonists and agonists, respectively, also show alteration of cognitive functions. Experimental studies showed that selective lesions of the dopaminergic neurons in rats or primates can actually provide cognitive deficits, especially when the mesocorticolimbic component of the dopaminergic systems is altered. Data from the experiments also showed significant alteration in attentional processes, thus raising the question of direct involvement of DA in regulating attention. Since the dopaminergic influence is mainly exerted over the frontal lobe and basal ganglia, it has been suggested that cognitive deficits express alteration in these subcortical brain structures closely linked to cortical areas, more than simple deficit in dopaminergic transmission. This point is still a matter of debate but, undoubtedly, DA acts as a powerful regulator of different aspects of cognitive brain functions. In this respect, normalizing DA transmission will contribute to improve the cognitive deficits not only related to neurologic or psychiatric diseases, but also in normal aging. Ontogenic and phylogenetic analysis of dopaminergic systems can provide evidences for a role of DA in the development of cognitive general capacities. DA can have a trophic action during maturation, which may influence the later cortical specification, particularly of pre-frontal cortical areas. Moreover, the characteristic extension of the dopaminergic cortical innervation in the rostro-caudal direction during the last stages of evolution in mammals can also be related to the appearance of progressively more developed cognitive capacities. Such an extension of cortical DA innervation could be related to increased processing of cortical information through basal ganglia, either during the course of evolution or development. DA has thus to be considered as a key neuroregulator which contributes to behavioral adaptation and to anticipatory processes necessary for preparing voluntary action consequent upon intention. All together, it can be suggested that a correlation exists between DA innervation and expression of cognitive capacities. Altering the dopaminergic transmission could, therefore, contribute to cognitive impairment.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent lesion and non-invasive studies identify the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala, not only with emotion but also with working memory in relation to the prefrontal cortex. In the present study, amygdalar neuronal activity was recorded from monkeys during performance of discrimination tasks that led to presentation of emotion-related (rewarding or aversive) stimuli. The task had three phases: (1) discrimination (visual, auditory), (2) operant response (bar pressing) and (3) ingestion (reward) or avoidance (aversion). These neurons were further analyzed by a short-term memory task, delayed pair comparison (DPC) using colored lamps. Of 585 amygdalar neurons, 107 responded primarily to single sensory stimulation (40 vision related, 26 audition related, 41 ingestion related), 117 to multimodal stimulation (multimodal) and 14 responded selectively to only one item (selective). Of 417 neurons tested by the DPC, 122 responded in one or more phases. Of these 122 neurons, 10.7\% responded in the delay period. These delay-responsive neurons also responded to various objects with positive and negative affective significance. These results suggest that amygdalar neurons are not specifically related to working memory, as are those in the inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices, but are related to more general non-specific functions or processes such as arousal or attention during the cognitive tasks. A functional role of the amygdala in working memory is discussed in terms of recent non-invasive studies suggesting a functional coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {The forebrain, including the amygdala (AM) and hypothalamus, may be a higher brain center that modulates the activity of a brainstem neural system that influences ingestive behavior via descending projections. In this study, to elucidate the characteristics of sensory information processing in the forebrain in relation to this putative connection, we recorded neuronal activity in the AM and hypothalamus [lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), medial hypothalamic area (MHA)] of rats during discrimination of conditioned sensory stimuli and the ingestion of various tastant solutions. Of 420 responsive AM neurons identified, 24 were taste responsive and located mainly in the central nucleus of the AM. Multivariate analyses of these taste neurons suggested that in the AM, taste quality is processed on the basis of palatability. In the hypothalamus, of 282 LHA and MHA neurons recorded, 144 responded to one or more conditioned auditory stimuli and/or licking of one or more solutions. Stress, which is known to influence feeding behavior, increased the mean spontaneous activity of LHA neurons but decreased the mean spontaneous neuronal activity of MHA neurons. This pattern of changes in spontaneous neuronal activity correlated with alterations in feeding behavior during stress. Furthermore, the activity of both AM and LHA neurons was modulated flexibly during conditioned associative learning. Together, the data suggest that the activity of the AM and hypothalamic neurons is altered when animals must modulate ingestive behavior by learning a new stimulus associated with food and by being exposed to stress, suggesting that these forebrain areas are important modulators of the activity of a basic neural system in the brainstem that influences ingestive behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Dopamine neurotransmission has long been known to exert a powerful influence over the vigor, strength, or rate of responding. However, there exists no clear understanding of the computational foundation for this effect; predominant accounts of dopamine's computational function focus on a role for phasic dopamine in controlling the discrete selection between different actions and have nothing to say about response vigor or indeed the free-operant tasks in which it is typically measured.

OBJECTIVES: We seek to accommodate free-operant behavioral tasks within the realm of models of optimal control and thereby capture how dopaminergic and motivational manipulations affect response vigor.

METHODS: We construct an average reward reinforcement learning model in which subjects choose both which action to perform and also the latency with which to perform it. Optimal control balances the costs of acting quickly against the benefits of getting reward earlier and thereby chooses a best response latency.

RESULTS: In this framework, the long-run average rate of reward plays a key role as an opportunity cost and mediates motivational influences on rates and vigor of responding. We review evidence suggesting that the average reward rate is reported by tonic levels of dopamine putatively in the nucleus accumbens.

CONCLUSIONS: Our extension of reinforcement learning models to free-operant tasks unites psychologically and computationally inspired ideas about the role of tonic dopamine in striatum, explaining from a normative point of view why higher levels of dopamine might be associated with more vigorous responding.},

  Abstract                 = {Progress in science depends on the effective exchange of ideas among scientists. New ideas can be assessed and criticized in a meaningful manner only if they are formulated precisely. This applies to simulation studies as well as to experiments and theories. But after more than 50 years of neuronal network simulations, we still lack a clear and common understanding of the role of computational models in neuroscience as well as established practices for describing network models in publications. This hinders the critical evaluation of network models as well as their re-use. We analyze here 14 research papers proposing neuronal network models of different complexity and find widely varying approaches to model descriptions, with regard to both the means of description and the ordering and placement of material. We further observe great variation in the graphical representation of networks and the notation used in equations. Based on our observations, we propose a good model description practice, composed of guidelines for the organization of publications, a checklist for model descriptions, templates for tables presenting model structure, and guidelines for diagrams of networks. The main purpose of this good practice is to trigger a debate about the communication of neuronal network models in a manner comprehensible to humans, as opposed to machine-readable model description languages. We believe that the good model description practice proposed here, together with a number of other recent initiatives on data-, model-, and software-sharing, may lead to a deeper and more fruitful exchange of ideas among computational neuroscientists in years to come. We further hope that work on standardized ways of describing--and thinking about--complex neuronal networks will lead the scientific community to a clearer understanding of high-level concepts in network dynamics, and will thus lead to deeper insights into the function of the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Temporal difference learning has been proposed as a model for Pavlovian conditioning, in which an animal learns to predict delivery of reward following presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS). A key component of this model is a prediction error signal, which, before learning, responds at the time of presentation of reward but, after learning, shifts its response to the time of onset of the CS. In order to test for regions manifesting this signal profile, subjects were scanned using event-related fMRI while undergoing appetitive conditioning with a pleasant taste reward. Regression analyses revealed that responses in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were significantly correlated with this error signal, suggesting that, during appetitive conditioning, computations described by temporal difference learning are expressed in the human brain.},

  Abstract                 = {The interactions among excitatory inputs arising from the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, and innervating nucleus accumbens neurons were studied using in vivo intracellular recording techniques. Neurons recorded in the accumbens displayed one of three activity states: (1) silent, (2) spontaneously firing at low, constant rates, or (3) a bistable membrane potential, characterized by alternating periods of activity and silence occurring in concert with spontaneous transitions between two steady-state membrane potentials (average, -77.3 +/- 7.1 mV base, -63.0 +/- 7.4 mV plateau). These neurons also exhibited a high degree of convergence of responses elicited by stimulation of each of the three excitatory inputs tested. Activation of hippocampal afferents, but not cortical, amygdaloid, or thalamic afferents, induced bistable cells to switch to the depolarized (active) state. In contrast, no bistable cells were encountered in the nucleus accumbens following an acute transection of the fornix. Furthermore, microinjection of lidocaine in the vicinity of the hippocampal afferents at the level of the fornix caused a reversible elimination of the plateau phase in bistable cells. These data suggest that hippocampal input is necessary for accumbens neurons to enter a depolarized, active state. Furthermore, activation of prefrontal cortical inputs fail to evoke spike firing in accumbens neurons unless they are in this active state. Consequently, the hippocampus appears to be capable of gating prefrontal corticoaccumbens throughput.},

  Abstract                 = {The prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory (the holding of information online for processing) and executive functions (deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing). Although many computational models of working memory have been developed, the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive, often amounting to a homunculus. This article presents an attempt to deconstruct this homunculus through powerful learning mechanisms that allow a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and amygdala, which together form an actor-critic architecture. The critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating. Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems. The model's performance compares favorably with standard backpropagation-based temporal learning mechanisms on the challenging 1-2-AX working memory task and other benchmark working memory tasks.},

The LV system comprises the neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala that excite DA cells. The authors show that the PVLV model can account for critical aspects of the DA firing data, making a number of clear predictions about lesion effects, several of which are consistent with existing data. For example, first- and second-order conditioning can be anatomically dissociated, which is consistent with PVLV and not TD. Overall, the model provides a biologically plausible framework for understanding the neural basis of reward learning.},

  Abstract                 = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

This hypothesis has only been applied to studies of long-term memory because the paradigmatic view of the hippocampus is that it is not critical for short-term forms of memory. However, relational processing is important in many working memory tasks, especially tasks using visual stimuli. Here, we test the hypothesis that the medial temporal lobes are important for relational memory even over short delays. The task required patients with medial temporal lobe amnesia and controls to remember three objects, locations, or object-location conjunctions over 1 or 8 s delays. The results show that working memory for objects and locations was at normal levels, but that memory for conjunctions was severely impaired at 8 s delays. Additional analyses suggest that the hippocampus per se is critical for accurate conjunction working memory. We propose that the hippocampus is critically involved in memory for conjunctions at both short and long delays.},

  Abstract                 = {Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons and their forebrain projections are critically involved in reward processing and cognitive functions. Descending projections from the lateral habenula (LHb) play a central role in inhibiting DA cell activity in response to the absence of expected rewards. As LHb efferents are reportedly glutamatergic, their ability to inhibit DA cells would theoretically require a disynaptic connection involving VTA GABA neurons and their local collateral inputs to DA cells. We therefore used anterograde tract-tracing from the LHb to investigate the relative selectivity of LHb synapses onto GABA versus DA VTA neurons. LHb axons were visualized using immunoperoxidase, and DA and GABA cells were marked by immunogold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or GABA, respectively. By ultrastructural analysis, 16\% of LHb axons were observed to form synaptic contacts in the VTA, and most of these were of an intermediate morphological type that did not exhibit definitive asymmetric or symmetric character. LHb axons synaptically targeted TH- and GABA-labeled dendrites to a comparable extent (45 and 52\% observed incidence, respectively). Pre-embedding immunogold labeling for the vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 and post-embedding immunogold staining for GABA confirmed that approximately 85\% of LHb terminals were glutamatergic and not GABAergic. These results suggest that the robust inhibition of DA cells evoked by the LHb is unlikely to arise from a selective innervation of VTA GABA neurons. Moreover, the LHb may mediate a direct excitation of DA cells that is over-ridden by indirect inhibition originating from an extrinsic source.},

  Abstract                 = {Amygdala role in emotion was reviewed in reference to recent amygdala lesion studies and neuronal responses in the rat amygdala to conditioned stimuli. Extensive lesion studies suggest that the amygdala is crucial in various kinds of motivated and emotional behavior, and related autonomic responses. These amygdala functions critically depend on learning and memory. Amygdala lesions, both before and after training of conditioned associative learning, impaired emotional expression without simple sensory-motor deficits. Pharmacological experiments indicated neurotransmission in the amygdala is mediated through NMDA and AMPA receptors. These results strongly suggest the amygdala is is acquiring and storing associative memory (i.e. stimulus-affect association) by which animals recognize and evaluate the biological significance of a stimulus. This information is then transferred to the brainstem executing system. In the neurophysiological experiments, there were topographic distributions of sensory-responsive neurons within the amygdala, which were well correlated to anatomical data. The responses of rat amygdala neurons changed plastically during learning. Furthermore, more sensory-responsive neurons were encountered in the amygdala of rats trained to associate the sensory stimuli with a reinforcement than in the amygdala of rats that were not trained. In trained rats, multimodal neurons that responded to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli were frequently found in the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala. The results suggest that basolateral and central nuclei are foci where various sensory modalities converge, and which might perform critical functions in acquiring and storing long-term associative memory to link between sensory information and affective significance.},

  Abstract                 = {In most species, the capability of perceiving and using the passage of time in the seconds-to-minutes range (interval timing) is not only accurate but also scalar: errors in time estimation are linearly related to the estimated duration. The ubiquity of scalar timing extends over behavioral, lesion, and pharmacological manipulations. For example, in mammals, dopaminergic drugs induce an immediate, scalar change in the perceived time (clock pattern), whereas cholinergic drugs induce a gradual, scalar change in perceived time (memory pattern). How do these properties emerge from unreliable, noisy neurons firing in the milliseconds range? Neurobiological information relative to the brain circuits involved in interval timing provide support for an striatal beat frequency (SBF) model, in which time is coded by the coincidental activation of striatal spiny neurons by cortical neural oscillators. While biologically plausible, the impracticality of perfect oscillators, or their lack thereof, questions this mechanism in a brain with noisy neurons. We explored the computational mechanisms required for the clock and memory patterns in an SBF model with biophysically realistic and noisy Morris-Lecar neurons (SBF-ML). Under the assumption that dopaminergic drugs modulate the firing frequency of cortical oscillators, and that cholinergic drugs modulate the memory representation of the criterion time, we show that our SBF-ML model can reproduce the pharmacological clock and memory patterns observed in the literature. Numerical results also indicate that parameter variability (noise) - which is ubiquitous in the form of small fluctuations in the intrinsic frequencies of neural oscillators within and between trials, and in the errors in recording/retrieving stored information related to criterion time - seems to be critical for the time-scale invariance of the clock and memory patterns.},

It has been argued to be a crucial mechanism for open-ended cognitive development in humans, and as such has gathered a growing interest from developmental roboticists in the recent years. The goal of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a synthesis of the different approaches of intrinsic motivation in psychology. Second, by interpreting these approaches in a computational reinforcement learning framework, we argue that they are not operational and even sometimes inconsistent. Third, we set the ground for a systematic operational study of intrinsic motivation by presenting a formal typology of possible computational approaches. This typology is partly based on existing computational models, but also presents new ways of conceptualizing intrinsic motivation. We argue that this kind of computational typology might be useful for opening new avenues for research both in psychology and developmental robotics.},

The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) to demonstrate that working memory processes within the human mid-dorsolateral and mid-ventrolateral frontal regions are organized according to the type of processing required rather than according to the nature (i.e. spatial or non-spatial), of the information being processed, as has been widely assumed. Two spatial working memory tasks were used which varied in the extent to which they required different executive processes. During a 'spatial span' task that required the subject to hold a sequence of five previously remembered locations in working memory a significant change in blood-flow was observed in the right mid-ventrolateral frontal cortex, but not in the anatomically and cytoarchitectonically distinct mid-dorsolateral frontal-lobe region. By contrast, during a '2-back' task that required the subject to continually update and manipulate an ongoing sequence of locations within working memory, significant blood flow increases were observed in both mid-ventrolateral and mid-dorsolateral frontal regions. When the two working memory tasks were compared directly, the one that emphasized manipulation of information within working memory yielded significantly greater activity in the right mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex only. This dissociation provides unambiguous evidence that the mid-dorsolateral and mid-ventrolateral frontal cortical areas make distinct functional contributions to spatial working memory and corresponds with a fractionation of working memory processes in psychological terms.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been shown that cells in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus exhibit response decrements when a visual stimulus is repeated. These response decrements have some of the properties associated with habituation, in particular, 1) spontaneous recovery and 2) habituation rate dependent on stimulus frequency. These observations have been made in two classes of neurons; direction-selective cells and so-called modified concentric cells. All of these neurons had small receptive fields and well-defined response properties. Some neurons in both the direction-selective and modified concentric groups do not show habituation. On the basis of area-threshold curves and other observations, it is suggested that those neurons which habituate possess strong inhibitory inputs which are weak or lacking in thenonhabituating neurons. This generalization leads to a hypothesis that inhibition in the superior colliculus has a long decay time and that a response to a given stimulus is affected by inhibition activated by preceding stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the mammalian basal ganglia have long been implicated in motor behavior, it is generally recognized that the behavioral functions of this subcortical group of structures are not exclusively motoric in nature. Extensive evidence now indicates a role for the basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, in learning and memory. One prominent hypothesis is that this brain region mediates a form of learning in which stimulus-response (S-R) associations or habits are incrementally acquired. Support for this hypothesis is provided by numerous neurobehavioral studies in different mammalian species, including rats, monkeys, and humans. In rats and monkeys, localized brain lesion and pharmacological approaches have been used to examine the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning. In humans, study of patients with neurodegenerative diseases that compromise the basal ganglia, as well as research using brain neuroimaging techniques, also provide evidence of a role for the basal ganglia in habit learning. Several of these studies have dissociated the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning from those of a cognitive or declarative medial temporal lobe memory system that includes the hippocampus as a primary component. Evidence suggests that during learning, basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe memory systems are activated simultaneously and that in some learning situations competitive interference exists between these two systems.},

We tested the hypothesis that projections from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) are involved in driving this DA cell activity. First, the activity of PPTg and DA neurons was compared in a cued-reward associative learning paradigm. The majority of PPTg neurons showed phasic responses to the onset of sensory cues, at significantly shorter latency than DA cells, consistent with a PPTg-to-DA transmission of information. However, unlike DA cells, PPTg responses were almost entirely independent of whether signals were associated with rewards. Second, DA neuron responses to the cues were recorded in free-moving rats during reversible inactivation of the PPTg by microinfusion of local anesthetic. The results showed clear suppression of conditioned sensory responses of DA neurons after PPTg inactivation that was not seen after saline infusion or in non-DA cells. We propose that the PPTg relays information about the precise timing of attended sensory events, which is integrated with information about reward context by DA neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {The last 10 years have witnessed a surge of interest for the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and extinction of classically conditioned fear responses. In part, this results from the realization that abnormalities in fear learning mechanisms likely participate in the development and/or maintenance of human anxiety disorders. The simplicity and robustness of this learning paradigm, coupled with the fact that the underlying circuitry is evolutionarily well conserved, make it an ideal model to study the basic biology of memory and identify genetic factors and neuronal systems that regulate the normal and pathological expressions of learned fear. Critical advances have been made in determining how modified neuronal functions upon fear acquisition become stabilized during fear memory consolidation and how these processes are controlled in the course of fear memory extinction. With these advances came the realization that activity in remote neuronal networks must be coordinated for these events to take place. In this paper, we review these mechanisms of coordinated network activity and the molecular cascades leading to enduring fear memory, and allowing for their extinction. We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component for the acquisition and extinction of fear responses.},

Attempts have been made to delineate the anatomical substrate of information processing along the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. Emphasis has been placed on data obtained with highly sensitive anterograde tract-tracing methods applied to the study of the main axis of the loop, which is composed of the striatum, the pallidum, and the substantia nigra. These findings have highlighted the complexities of the organization of the intrinsic basal ganglia circuitry, which comprises multiple modular units that are distributed according to highly ordered and repetitive patterns. Such an arrangement is well suited to convey cortical information in a highly specific manner throughout the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia circuitry is also designed so as to modulate in a precise manner the neuronal activity of several brain functional systems, which are involved in the direct control of different aspects of psychomotor behavior. Of utmost importance is the action of the basal ganglia on thalamocortical premotor neurons. It is through these neurons, which can be considered as a sort of final common pathway, that the basal ganglia ultimately influence the complex neuronal computation that goes on at cortical level.},

The direct and indirect pathways form the conceptual framework of the anatomical and functional organization of the basal ganglia. A review of recent data regarding the connections of the subthalamic nucleus and the GPe has revealed a lack of firm anatomical support for the existence of the indirect pathway. However, newly recognized projections of the subthalamic nucleus and the GPe place these structures on various novel routes that change the conceptual architecture of the basal ganglia circuitry. These new findings force us to modify our view of the functional identity of the subthalamic nucleus and the GPe. In this new perspective, the GPe stands as an additional integrative station, together with the striatum and the internal pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata (GPi/SNr), along the main steam of information processing within the basal ganglia circuitry. Because of its crucial position between the input and output stations of the basal ganglia, the GPe can markedly influence the neuronal computation that occurs at GPi/SNr levels. The subthalamic nucleus can still be regarded as a 'control structure' lying alongside the main stream of information processing. However, because of its widespread efferent projections, the subthalamic nucleus exerts its driving effect on most components of the basal ganglia. Its action is mediated not only by the indirect pathway, but by a multitude of mono- and polysynaptic projections that ultimately reach the basal ganglia output cells.},

The mediodorsal thalamus receives a large projection from the rhinal cortex, and has been implicated in recognition memory performance. We trained monkeys preoperatively in delayed matching-to-sample with large and small stimulus populations, exactly as in the earlier studies, then examined the effect of bilaterally ablating the medial portion of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Mediodorsal lesion impaired postoperative delayed matching-to-sample performance with a large stimulus set, but had no effect on performance of DMS with a small stimulus population. In comparison with the earlier data from rhinal cortex lesions with the same methods, wherever a deficit was seen in the rhinal-lesioned animals the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals showed a smaller deficit. We conclude that other efferents from the rhinal cortex, possibly those to the adjacent inferior temporal cortex, enable better performance in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals than in the animals with rhinal cortex ablation.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine the respective contribution of the subcortical structures and the prefrontal cortex in behavioural adaptation, we applied the delayed response paradigm, considered as a functional marker of the dorsolateral region of the prefrontal cortex, to patients with striatal dysfunction: Parkinson's disease (n = 27), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 20); to patients with prefrontal lesions (n = 10) and to normal control subjects (n = 24). The performance of each group was compared in four experiments: a delayed response task in which the correct answer was previously indicated by an explicit cue (externally guided task); delayed alternation and non-alternation tasks coupled with a delayed reversal task in which the patient had to discover the rule by himself in the absence of explicit cues (internally driven tasks). All groups of patients showed a short-term spatial representational memory deficit in the externally guided situation. Patients with striatal dysfunction showed difficulties in re-engaging attention on a new programme and in maintaining it. However, they did not express the spontaneous tendency to alternate nor the severe difficulties in disengaging from a previous pattern of response demonstrated by patients with prefrontal lesions. These results validate the concept of a striato-frontal functional system in humans and suggest the existence of two different levels of behavioural organization: elaboration of new programmes of behaviour in association with inhibition of previously established ones, that might be under frontal lobe control: maintenance of the new programme until the action has been accomplished and automatization for a routine utilization, that might be under control of the striatum.},

Attention is drawn to the similarity of the neuroses and psychoses to behavior observed in the dog during certain of the experiments.

  Abstract                 = {NEVESIM is a software package for event-driven simulation of networks of spiking neurons with a fast simulation core in C++, and a scripting user interface in the Python programming language. It supports simulation of heterogeneous networks with different types of neurons and synapses, and can be easily extended by the user with new neuron and synapse types. To enable heterogeneous networks and extensibility, NEVESIM is designed to decouple the simulation logic of communicating events (spikes) between the neurons at a network level from the implementation of the internal dynamics of individual neurons. In this paper we will present the simulation framework of NEVESIM, its concepts and features, as well as some aspects of the object-oriented design approaches and simulation strategies that were utilized to efficiently implement the concepts and functionalities of the framework. We will also give an overview of the Python user interface, its basic commands and constructs, and also discuss the benefits of integrating NEVESIM with Python. One of the valuable capabilities of the simulator is to simulate exactly and efficiently networks of stochastic spiking neurons from the recently developed theoretical framework of neural sampling. This functionality was implemented as an extension on top of the basic NEVESIM framework. Altogether, the intended purpose of the NEVESIM framework is to provide a basis for further extensions that support simulation of various neural network models incorporating different neuron and synapse types that can potentially also use different simulation strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {A central problem in cognitive neuroscience is how animals can manage to rapidly master complex sensorimotor tasks when the only sensory feedback they use to improve their performance is a simple reinforcing stimulus. Neural network theorists have constructed algorithms for reinforcement learning that can be used to solve a variety of biological problems and do not violate basic neurophysiological principles, in contrast to the back-propagation algorithm. A key assumption in these models is the existence of a reinforcement signal, which would be diffusively broadcast throughout one or several brain areas engaged in learning. This signal is further assumed to mediate up- and downward changes in synaptic efficacy by acting as a multiplicative factor in learning rules. The biological plausibility of these algorithms has been defended by the conjecture that the neuromodulators noradrenaline, acetylcholine or dopamine may form the neurochemical substrate of reinforcement signals. In this commentary, the predictions raised by this hypothesis are compared to anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural findings. The experimental evidence does not support, and often argues against, a general reinforcement-encoding function of these neuromodulatory systems. Nevertheless, the broader concept of evaluative signalling between brain structures implied in learning appears to be reasonable and the available algorithms may open new avenues for constructing more realistic network architectures.},

The present study compared the effect on visual working memory of lesions restricted to the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the monkey with that of lesions to the anterior inferotemporal cortex, a region of the temporal cortex specialized for visual memory. Increasing the delay during which information had to be maintained in visual working memory impaired performance after lesions of the anterior inferotemporal cortex, but not after mid-dorsolateral prefrontal lesions. By contrast, increasing the number of stimuli that had to be monitored impaired the performance of animals with mid-dorsolateral prefrontal lesions, but not that of animals with anterior inferotemporal lesions. This demonstration of a double dissociation between the effects of these two lesions provides strong evidence that the role of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in visual working memory does not lie in the maintenance of information per se, but rather in the executive process of monitoring this information. In addition, the present study demonstrated that lesions limited to area 9, which constitutes the superior part of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region, give rise to a mild impairment in the monitoring of information, whereas lesions of the complete mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region yield a very severe impairment.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical experiments on spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) use a protocol based on pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes repeated at a given frequency to induce synaptic potentiation or depression. Therefore, standard STDP models have expressed the weight change as a function of pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic spike. Unfortunately, those paired-based STDP models cannot account for the dependence on the repetition frequency of the pairs of spike. Moreover, those STDP models cannot reproduce recent triplet and quadruplet experiments. Here, we examine a triplet rule (i.e., a rule which considers sets of three spikes, i.e., two pre and one post or one pre and two post) and compare it to classical pair-based STDP learning rules. With such a triplet rule, it is possible to fit experimental data from visual cortical slices as well as from hippocampal cultures. Moreover, when assuming stochastic spike trains, the triplet learning rule can be mapped to a Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning rule.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well established in nonhuman primates that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, the hippocampus and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, are necessary for declarative memory encoding. In humans, the neuropathological and neuropsychological changes in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) further support a role for the rhinal cortex in the consolidation of new events into long-term memory. Little is known, however, regarding the function of the rhinal cortex in humans in vivo. To examine the participation of the interconnected MTL structures as well as the whole-brain network of activated brain areas in visual associative long-term memory, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to determine the brain regions that are activated during encoding and retrieval of paired pictures in 12 young control subjects. The most striking finding in the MTL activation pattern was the consistent activation of the perirhinal cortex in the encoding-baseline and encoding-retrieval comparisons with a strict statistical threshold (P < 0.00001). In contrast, no perirhinal cortex activation was detected in the retrieval-baseline or retrieval-encoding comparisons even with a low statistical threshold (P < 0.05). The location of the perirhinal activation area was in the transentorhinal part of the perirhinal cortex, in the medial bank of the collateral sulcus. The hippocampus and the more posterior parahippocampal gyrus were activated in both encoding and retrieval conditions. During the encoding processing, MTL activations were more consistent and the hippocampal activation area located more anteriorly than during retrieval. The frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital association cortices were also activated in the encoding-baseline and retrieval-baseline comparisons. The data suggest that encoding, but not retrieval, of novel picture pairs activates the perirhinal cortex. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study reporting encoding activation in this transentorhinal part of the perirhinal cortex, the site of the very earliest neuropathological changes in AD.},

  Abstract                 = {An in vitro system was established to analyse corticostriatal processing. Cortical and striatal slices taken at postnatal days 0-2 were co-cultured for three to six weeks. The anatomy of the organotypic co-cultures was determined using immunohistochemistry. In the cortex parvalbumin-positive and calbindin-positive cells, which resembled those seen in vivo, had laminar distributions. In the striatum, strongly stained parvalbumin-positive cells resembling striatal GABAergic interneurons and cholinergic interneurons were scattered throughout the tissue. The soma area of these interneuron classes was larger than the average striatal soma area, thus enabling visual selection of cells by class before recording. Cortical neurons with projections to the striatum showed similar morphological features to corticostriatal projection neurons in vivo. No projections from the striatum to the cortex were found. Intracellular recordings were obtained from 94 neurons. These were first classified on the basis of electrophysiological characteristics and the morphologies of cells in each class were reconstructed. Two types of striatal secondary neurons with unique electrophysiological dynamics were identified: GABAergic interneurons (n = 17) and large aspiny, probably cholinergic, interneurons (n = 15). The electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of cortical pyramidal cells (n = 27), cortical interneurons (n = 1), as well as striatal principal neurons (n = 34), were identical to those reported for similar ages in vivo. Organotypic cortex-striatum co-cultures are therefore suitable as an in vitro system in which to analyse corticostriatal processing. The network dynamics, which developed spontaneously in that system, are examined in the companion paper.},

  Abstract                 = {The subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia (STN) is important for normal movement as well as in movement disorders. Lesioning or deep-brain stimulation of the STN can alleviate resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. The STN and its target nuclei display synchronized oscillatory burst discharge at low frequencies, some of which correlate with tremor, but the mechanism underlying this synchronized bursting is unknown. Here we show that the excitatory STN and inhibitory, external globus pallidus (GPe) form a feedback system that engages in synchronized bursting. In mature organotypic cortex-striatum-STN-GPe cultures, neurons in the STN and GPe spontaneously produce synchronized oscillating bursts at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.8 Hz. Pallidal lesion abolishes this bursting, whereas cortical lesion favours bursting at 0.8 Hz. Pallidal bursts, although weaker than STN bursts, were required for synchronized oscillatory burst generation by recruitment of subthalmic rebound excitation. We propose that the STN and GPe constitute a central pacemaker modulated by striatal inhibition of GPe neurons. This pacemaker could be responsible for synchronized oscillatory activity in the normal and pathological basal ganglia.},

  Abstract                 = {Homeostasis describes the fundamental biological ability of individuals to maintain stable internal conditions in a changing environment. Homeostatic reactions include internal adjustments as well as behavioral responses. In vertebrates, behavioral responses are induced by the reward system. This system originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and leads to increased dopamine levels in the forebrain whenever activated. A major inhibitor of VTA activity is the lateral habenula (LHb). This epithalamic structure is able to almost completely suppress dopamine release, either directly or via the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), when rewarding expectations are not met. A major input to the LHb arises from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), an important regulator of the homeostatic system. Currently, little is known about the effects of the strong hypothalamic projection on the activity of LHb neurons. In the present study, we analyze neurotransmitters and cellular targets of the LHA-LHb projection in the rat. Therefore, anterograde tracing from the LHA was combined with the visualization of neurotransmitters in the LHb. These experiments revealed a mainly glutamatergic projection, probably exerting excitatory effects on the targeted LHb cells. These cellular targets were analyzed in a second step. Anterograde tracing from the LHA in combination with retrograde tracing from the VTA/RMTg region revealed that LHb neurons projecting to the VTA/RMTg region are densely targeted by the LHA projection. Visualization of synaptophysin at these contact sites indicates that the contact sites indeed are synapses. Taken together, the present study describes a strong mainly glutamatergic projection from the LHA that targets VTA/RMTg-projecting neurons in the LHb. These findings emphasize the potential role of the LHb as direct link between homeostatic areas and reward circuitries, which may be important for the control of homeostatic behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {We employed a novel event-related fMRI design and analysis technique to explore caudate nucleus contributions to spatial and nonspatial working memory. The spatial condition of a delayed-response task revealed greater mnemonic activation in four of six subjects when the delay period preceded immediately a probe stimulus requiring an overt motor response, as contrasted with a probe requiring no response. This effect was not seen in frontal or parietal cortical areas, and was seen in the caudate nucleus in a formally identical object condition in just one of six subjects. We hypothesized that this pattern of activity represented spatially dependent motor preparation. A second experiment confirmed this hypothesis: delay-period activity of the caudate nucleus showed greater time dependence in a task that featured spatial and motoric memory demands than in a comparable nonspatial task that featured the same response contingencies. These results suggest an important subcortical locus of the dissociation between spatial and nonspatial working memory, and a role for the human caudate nucleus in the integration of spatially coded mnemonic information with motor preparation to guide behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Many psychological learning theories have noted commonalities between aversive states produced by presentation of negative reinforcers, such as electric shock, and the omission of expected positive reinforcers, such as food. Here, three groups of rats received training with one auditory cue paired with shock and another with the omission of expected food, a shock-paired cue and a food-omission control cue, or a food-omission cue and a shock control cue. Food-omission cues were established by contrast with food delivery; after extensive light-food pairings, the light was followed by the food-omission cue instead of food. Aversiveness of the food-omission cue was assessed with a conditioned punishment procedure, in which presentation of that cue was made contingent on performance of one previously trained instrumental response, whereas a second response had no consequences. We found that rats with lesions of amygdala central nucleus (CeA) showed impaired acquisition of freezing to the cue paired with shock and no evidence for acquisition of aversive properties by the cue that accompanied the omission of expected food. Furthermore, analyses of Arc and Homer1a mRNAs after rats were exposed to a two-epoch test procedure that allowed assessment of gene expression produced by two different test stimuli showed that both food-omission and shock-paired cues generated more neuronal activity in CeA than appropriate control cues. However, the number of neurons that were activated by both shock and food-omission cues was not significantly greater than expected by chance. Thus, under these test conditions, different subsets of CeA neurons represented these two aversive states.},

  Abstract                 = {GABA neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata receive input from GABAergic fibers originating in the forebrain. The role of dopaminergic D1 receptors located on these fibers was investigated using tight-seal whole-cell recordings from visually identified pars reticulata neurons of rat substantia nigra slices. Nondopaminergic pars reticulata neurons were characterized by their electrophysiological properties. Postsynaptic currents evoked by minimal stimulation in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists were blocked by bicuculline, indicating that they were GABAA IPSCs. Evoked GABAA IPSCs were potentiated by D1 receptor agonists. After application of D1 receptor agonists, miniature IPSCs [recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+] increased in frequency but not in amplitude. Effects of D1 receptor stimulation were mimicked by forskolin, as expected, if a cAMP-dependent mechanism was involved. The D1 antagonist SCH23390 blocked the effects of the agonists, and perfusion with SCH23390 resulted in a reduction of evoked IPSCs. In TTX and Cd2+, which prevented dopamine release, the D1 antagonist had no effect on miniature IPSCs. Blocking of monoamine uptake by imipramine increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs. We conclude that dopamine released from dendrites of dopaminergic neurons enhances GABA release in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra through D1 receptors presumably located on striatonigral afferents. These D1 receptors, thereby, can reinforce D1 receptor-mediated activation of striatal projection neurons that inhibit the inhibitory output neurons of the basal ganglia in substantia nigra.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the timecourse of neural activity in the primate (Macacca mulatta) prefrontal (PF) cortex during an object delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) task. To assess the effects of experience on this timecourse, we conducted the task using both novel and highly familiar objects. In addition, noise patterns containing no task-relevant information were used as samples on some trials. Comparison of average PF ensemble activity relative to baseline activity generated by objects and noise patterns revealed three distinct activity periods. (i) Sample onset elicited a transient sensory visual response. In this sensory period, novel objects elicited stronger average ensemble activity than both familiar objects and noise patterns. (ii) An intermediate period of elevated activity followed, which began before sample offset, and continued well into the delay period. In the intermediate period, activity was elevated for noise patterns and novel objects, but near baseline for familiar objects. (iii) Finally, after average ensemble activity reached baseline activity at the end of the intermediate period, a reactivation period occurred late in the delay. Experience had little effect during reactivation, where activity was elevated for both novel and familiar objects compared to noise patterns. We show that the ensemble average resembles the activity timecourse of many single prefrontal neurons. These results suggest that PF delay activity does not merely maintain recent sensory input, but is subject to more complex experience-dependent dynamics. This has implications for how delay activity is generated and maintained.},

Activity within category-selective subregions of inferior temporal cortex reflected the type of information that was actively maintained during both the associative memory and working memory tasks. In addition, activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was specifically enhanced during associative memory retrieval. These data are consistent with the view that the active maintenance of visual information is supported by activation of object representations in inferior temporal cortex, but that goal-directed associative memory retrieval additionally depends on top-down signals from the anterior prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental problem faced by animals is learning to select actions based on noisy sensory information and incomplete knowledge of the world. It has been suggested that the brain engages in Bayesian inference during perception but how such probabilistic representations are used to select actions has remained unclear. Here we propose a neural model of action selection and decision making based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Actions are selected based not on a single "optimal" estimate of state but on the posterior distribution over states (the "belief" state). We show how such a model provides a unified framework for explaining experimental results in decision making that involve both information gathering and overt actions. The model utilizes temporal difference (TD) learning for maximizing expected reward. The resulting neural architecture posits an active role for the neocortex in belief computation while ascribing a role to the basal ganglia in belief representation, value computation, and action selection. When applied to the random dots motion discrimination task, model neurons representing belief exhibit responses similar to those of LIP neurons in primate neocortex. The appropriate threshold for switching from information gathering to overt actions emerges naturally during reward maximization. Additionally, the time course of reward prediction error in the model shares similarities with dopaminergic responses in the basal ganglia during the random dots task. For tasks with a deadline, the model learns a decision making strategy that changes with elapsed time, predicting a collapsing decision threshold consistent with some experimental studies. The model provides a new framework for understanding neural decision making and suggests an important role for interactions between the neocortex and the basal ganglia in learning the mapping between probabilistic sensory representations and actions that maximize rewards.},

  Abstract                 = {Dedicated hardware is becoming increasingly essential to simulate emerging very-large-scale neural models. Equally, however, it needs to be able to support multiple models of the neural dynamics, possibly operating simultaneously within the same system. This may be necessary either to simulate large models with heterogeneous neural types, or to simplify simulation and analysis of detailed, complex models in a large simulation by isolating the new model to a small subpopulation of a larger overall network. The SpiNNaker neuromimetic chip is a dedicated neural processor able to support such heterogeneous simulations. Implementing these models on-chip uses an integrated library-based tool chain incorporating the emerging PyNN interface that allows a modeller to input a high-level description and use an automated process to generate an on-chip simulation. Simulations using both \{LIF\} and Izhikevich models demonstrate the ability of the SpiNNaker system to generate and simulate heterogeneous networks on-chip, while illustrating, through the network-scale effects of wavefront synchronisation and burst gating, methods that can provide effective behavioural abstractions for large-scale hardware modelling. SpiNNaker’s asynchronous virtual architecture permits greater scope for model exploration, with scalable levels of functional and temporal abstraction, than conventional (or neuromorphic) computing platforms. The complete system illustrates a potential path to understanding the neural model of computation, by building (and breaking) neural models at various scales, connecting the blocks, then comparing them against the biology: computational cognitive neuroscience. },

  Abstract                 = {An early finding in the behavioral analysis of learning was that conditioned responding weakens as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) are separated in time. This "trace" conditioning effect has been the focus of years of research in associative learning. Theoretical accounts of trace conditioning have focused on mechanisms that allow associative learning to occur across long intervals between the CS and US. These accounts have emphasized degraded contingency effects, timing mechanisms, and inhibitory learning. More recently, study of the neurobiology of trace conditioning has shown that even a short interval between the CS and US alters the circuitry recruited for learning. Here, we review some of the theoretical and neurobiological mechanisms underlying trace conditioning with an emphasis on recent studies of trace fear conditioning. Findings across many studies have implications not just for how we think about time and conditioning, but also for how we conceptualize fear conditioning in general, suggesting that circuitry beyond the usual suspects needs to be incorporated into current thinking about fear, learning, and anxiety.},

  Abstract                 = {The basal ganglia have been associated with processes of reinforcement learning. A strong line of supporting evidence comes from the recording of dopamine (DA) neurones in behaving monkeys. Unpredicted, biologically salient events, including rewards cause a stereotypic short-latency (70-100 ms), short-duration (100-200 ms) burst of DA activity - the phasic response. This response is widely considered to represent reward prediction errors used as teaching signals in appetitive learning to promote actions that will maximise future reward acquisition. For DA signalling to perform this function, sensory processing afferent to DA neurones should discriminate unpredicted reward-related events. However, the comparative response latencies of DA neurones and orienting gaze-shifts indicate that phasic DA responses are triggered by pre-attentive sensory processing. Consequently, in circumstances where biologically salient events are both spatially and temporally unpredictable, it is unlikely their identity will be known at the time of DA signalling. The limited quality of afferent sensory processing and the precise timing of phasic DA signals, suggests that they may play a less direct role in 'Law of Effect' appetitive learning. Rather, the 'time-stamp' nature of the phasic response, in conjunction with the other signals likely to be present in the basal ganglia at the time of phasic DA input, suggests it may reinforce the discovery of unpredicted sensory events for which the organism is responsible. Furthermore, DA-promoted repetition of preceding actions/movements should enable the system to converge on those aspects of context and behavioural output that lead to the discovery of novel actions.},

  Abstract                 = {Unexpected stimuli that are behaviourally significant have the capacity to elicit a short-latency, short-duration burst of firing in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones. An influential interpretation of the experimental data that characterize this response proposes that dopaminergic neurones have a crucial role in reinforcement learning because they signal error in the prediction of future reward. In this article we propose a different functional role for this 'short-latency dopamine response' in the mechanisms that underlie associative learning. We suggest that the initial burst of dopaminergic-neurone firing could represent an essential component in the process of switching attentional and behavioural selections to unexpected, behaviourally important stimuli. This switching response could be a crucial prerequisite for associative learning and might be part of a general short-latency response that is mediated by catecholamines and prepares the organism for an appropriate reaction to biologically significant events.Any act which in a given situation produces satisfaction becomes associated with that situation so that when the situation recurs the act is more likely than before to recur also.

  Abstract                 = {Progressive loss of the ascending dopaminergic projection in the basal ganglia is a fundamental pathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Studies in animals and humans have identified spatially segregated functional territories in the basal ganglia for the control of goal-directed and habitual actions. In patients with Parkinson's disease the loss of dopamine is predominantly in the posterior putamen, a region of the basal ganglia associated with the control of habitual behaviour. These patients may therefore be forced into a progressive reliance on the goal-directed mode of action control that is mediated by comparatively preserved processing in the rostromedial striatum. Thus, many of their behavioural difficulties may reflect a loss of normal automatic control owing to distorting output signals from habitual control circuits, which impede the expression of goal-directed action.},

Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex. Thus, efferent fibers from a single origin in either prefrontal or anterior temporal cortex terminated in different patterns depending on their target area. Conversely, axons terminated in different patterns in a single target area, prefrontal or anterior temporal, depending on their area of origin. Projections from agranular or dysgranular type cortices (e.g. medial temporal areas and caudal orbitofrontal areas) terminated mostly in the upper layers of granular cortices (e.g. area TE and lateral prefrontal areas), and projections from granular cortices terminated mostly in the deep layers of agranular or dys- granular cortices. A robust projection from dysgranular orbitofrontal areas terminated in the deep layers of the agranular entorhinal cortex. Projections from prefrontal areas to area TE terminated in the upper layers, and may facilitate focused attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli processed through reciprocal pathways between prefrontal and temporal cortices.},

  Abstract                 = {There are a number of ways one can hope to describe and explain cognitive abilities, each of them contributing a unique and valuable perspective. Cognitive psychology tries to develop and test functional accounts of cognitive systems that explain the capacities and properties of cognitive abilities as revealed by empirical data gathered by a range of behavioral experimental paradigms. Much of the research in the cognitive psychology of working memory has been strongly influenced by the multi-component model of working memory [Baddeley AD, Hitch GJ (1974) Working memory. In: Recent advances in learning and motivation, Vol. 8 (Bower GA, ed), pp 47-90. New York: Academic Press; Baddeley AD (1986) Working memory. Oxford, UK: Clarendon Press; Baddeley A. Working memory: Thought and action. Oxford: Oxford University Press, in press]. By expanding the notion of a passive short-term memory to an active system that provides the basis for complex cognitive abilities, the model has opened up numerous questions and new lines of research. In this paper we present the current revision of the multi-component model that encompasses a central executive, two unimodal storage systems: a phonological loop and a visuospatial sketchpad, and a further component, a multimodal store capable of integrating information into unitary episodic representations, termed episodic buffer. We review recent empirical data within experimental cognitive psychology that has shaped the development of the multicomponent model and the understanding of the capacities and properties of working memory. Research based largely on dual-task experimental designs and on neuropsychological evidence has yielded valuable information about the fractionation of working memory into independent stores and processes, the nature of representations in individual stores, the mechanisms of their maintenance and manipulation, the way the components of working memory relate to each other, and the role they play in other cognitive abilities. With many questions still open and new issues emerging, we believe that the multicomponent model will continue to stimulate research while providing a comprehensive functional description of working memory.},

  Abstract                 = {The brain has the ability to represent the passage of time between two behaviorally relevant events. Recordings from different areas in the cortex of monkeys suggest the existence of neurons representing time by increasing (climbing) activity, which is triggered by a first event and peaks at the expected time of a second event, e.g., a visual stimulus or a reward. When the typical interval between the two events is changed, the slope of the climbing activity adapts to the new timing. We present a model in which the climbing activity results from slow firing rate adaptation in inhibitory neurons. Hebbian synaptic modifications allow for learning the new time interval by changing the degree of firing rate adaptation. This event-based representation of time is consistent with Weber's law in interval timing, according to which the error in estimating a time interval is proportional to the interval length.},

  Abstract                 = {Positive reinforcement helps to control the acquisition of learned behaviours. Here we report a cellular mechanism in the brain that may underlie the behavioural effects of positive reinforcement. We used intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) as a model of reinforcement learning, in which each rat learns to press a lever that applies reinforcing electrical stimulation to its own substantia nigra. The outputs from neurons of the substantia nigra terminate on neurons in the striatum in close proximity to inputs from the cerebral cortex on the same striatal neurons. We measured the effect of substantia nigra stimulation on these inputs from the cortex to striatal neurons and also on how quickly the rats learned to press the lever. We found that stimulation of the substantia nigra (with the optimal parameters for lever-pressing behaviour) induced potentiation of synapses between the cortex and the striatum, which required activation of dopamine receptors. The degree of potentiation within ten minutes of the ICSS trains was correlated with the time taken by the rats to learn ICSS behaviour. We propose that stimulation of the substantia nigra when the lever is pressed induces a similar potentiation of cortical inputs to the striatum, positively reinforcing the learning of the behaviour by the rats.},

We consider this new knowledge in relation to three factors proposed earlier to describe the rules for synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. These factors are a phasic increase in dopamine release, presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarisation. A function is proposed which relates the amount of dopamine release in the striatum to the modulation of corticostriatal synaptic efficacy. It is argued that this function, and the experimental data from which it arises, are compatible with existing models which associate the reward-related firing of dopamine neurons with changes in corticostriatal synaptic efficacy.},

These two systems interact in certain learning and motor control mechanisms of the brain. We investigated these interactions using intracellular recording from spiny striatal neurons in urethane-anaesthetized rats. We found that acute dopamine depletion was associated with long-term depression of corticostriatal synaptic input. Electrical stimulation of the cortex which mimicked synchronous cortical input to striatal neurons also induced long-term depression of corticostriatal inputs. In intact control animals, but not in dopamine-depleted animals, this depression was prevented or reversed by concomitant stimulation of the substantia nigra. In agreement with previous in vitro studies, our in vivo findings show that long-term depression occurs in the corticostriatal pathway, and in addition show that it is regulated by dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra. This form of synaptic plasticity may therefore be important for understanding disturbances of the motor system seen in humans with Parkinson's disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopaminergic models based on the temporal-difference learning algorithm usually do not differentiate trace from delay conditioning. Instead, they use a fixed temporal representation of elapsed time since conditioned stimulus onset. Recently, a new model was proposed in which timing is learned within a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network representing the cerebral cortex (Rivest et al. in J Comput Neurosci 28(1):107-130, 2010). In this paper, that model's ability to reproduce and explain relevant data, as well as its ability to make interesting new predictions, are evaluated. The model reveals a strikingly different temporal representation between trace and delay conditioning since trace conditioning requires working memory to remember the past conditioned stimulus while delay conditioning does not. On the other hand, the model predicts no important difference in DA responses between those two conditions when trained on one conditioning paradigm and tested on the other. The model predicts that in trace conditioning, animal timing starts with the conditioned stimulus offset as opposed to its onset. In classical conditioning, it predicts that if the conditioned stimulus does not disappear after the reward, the animal may expect a second reward. Finally, the last simulation reveals that the buildup of activity of some units in the networks can adapt to new delays by adjusting their rate of integration. Most importantly, the paper shows that it is possible, with the proposed architecture, to acquire discharge patterns similar to those observed in dopaminergic neurons and in the cerebral cortex on those tasks simply by minimizing a predictive cost function.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopaminergic neuron activity has been modeled during learning and appetitive behavior, most commonly using the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. However, a proper representation of elapsed time and of the exact task is usually required for the model to work. Most models use timing elements such as delay-line representations of time that are not biologically realistic for intervals in the range of seconds. The interval-timing literature provides several alternatives. One of them is that timing could emerge from general network dynamics, instead of coming from a dedicated circuit. Here, we present a general rate-based learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks that learns a time representation when needed. Using a na\"{\i}ve network learning its environment in conjunction with TD, we reproduce dopamine activity in appetitive trace conditioning with a constant CS-US interval, including probe trials with unexpected delays. The proposed model learns a representation of the environment dynamics in an adaptive biologically plausible framework, without recourse to delay lines or other special-purpose circuits. Instead, the model predicts that the task-dependent representation of time is learned by experience, is encoded in ramp-like changes in single-neuron activity distributed across small neural networks, and reflects a temporal integration mechanism resulting from the inherent dynamics of recurrent loops within the network. The model also reproduces the known finding that trace conditioning is more difficult than delay conditioning and that the learned representation of the task can be highly dependent on the types of trials experienced during training. Finally, it suggests that the phasic dopaminergic signal could facilitate learning in the cortex.},

At the single-neuron level, the new approaches involve reformulation of dynamics in synapses, dendrites, cell bodies, and axons to enable new types of analysis, longer numerical timesteps, and demonstration that rate-based methods can predict spike times. In multineuron systems, hybrids and intermediates between spike-based and field-based coupling between neurons are used to provide stepping stones between descriptions based on pairwise spike-based interactions between neurons and ones based on neural field-based interactions within and between populations, including arbitrary spatial structure and temporal delays in the connections in general. In particular, a new neuron-in-cell approach is introduced that is a hybrid between neural field theory and spiking-neuron models in analogy to particle-in-cell methods in plasma physics. This approach enables large speedups in computations while preserving spike shapes and times. Various approaches are illustrated numerically for specific cases. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {A dopaminergic deficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) causes abnormalities of movement, behaviour, learning, and emotions. The main motor features (ie, tremor, rigidity, and akinesia) are associated with a deficiency of dopamine in the posterior putamen and the motor circuit. Hypokinesia and bradykinesia might have a dual anatomo-functional basis: hypokinesia mediated by brainstem mechanisms and bradykinesia by cortical mechanisms. The classic pathophysiological model for PD (ie, hyperactivity in the globus pallidus pars interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata) does not explain rigidity and tremor, which might be caused by changes in primary motor cortex activity. Executive functions (ie, planning and problem solving) are also impaired in early PD, but are usually not clinically noticed. These impairments are associated with dopamine deficiency in the caudate nucleus and with dysfunction of the associative and other non-motor circuits. Apathy, anxiety, and depression are the main psychiatric manifestations in untreated PD, which might be caused by ventral striatum dopaminergic deficit and depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine. In this Review we discuss the motor, cognitive, and psychiatric manifestations associated with the dopaminergic deficiency in the early phase of the parkinsonian state and the different circuits implicated, and we propose distinct mechanisms to explain the wide clinical range of PD symptoms at the time of diagnosis.},

Some neurons had activity related to working memory, in that they responded more to the sample than to the match image within a trial, as shown previously. However, when a novel set of stimuli was introduced, the neuronal responses were on average only 47\% of the magnitude of the responses to the set of very familiar stimuli. Moreover, it was shown in three monkeys that the responses of the perirhinal cortex neurons gradually increased over hundreds of presentations (mean = 400 over 7-13 days) of the new set of (initially novel) stimuli to become as large as those to the already familiar stimuli. Thus perirhinal cortex neurons represent the very long-term familiarity of visual stimuli. Part of the impairment in temporal lobe amnesia may be related to the difficulty of building representations of the degree of familiarity of stimuli. A neural network model of how the perirhinal cortex could implement long-term familiarity memory is proposed using Hebbian associative learning.},

In the anteroventral part of the inferotemporal cortex, neurones were found with visual responses which were sustained while the animal looked at the appropriate visual stimuli. The latency of the responses was 100 msec or more. The majority (96/142 or 68\%) of these neurones responded more strongly to some stimuli than to others. These units usually had different responses when objects were shown from different views, and physical factors such as shape, size, orientation, colour and texture appeared to account for the responses of some of these units. Association of visual stimuli with a food reward (glucose solution) or an aversive taste (5\% saline solution) did not affect the magnitude of the responses of the neurones to the stimuli either during the learning or after the period of learning. Nor did feeding the monkey to satiety affect the responses of the neurones to their effective stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {Through the influence of Goldman-Rakic, much research has been focused on the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in spatial working memory, decision making, and saccade generation, whereas functions of other parts of the frontal lobe including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) are less clear. Previous studies in non-human primates have shown that some VLPFC cells are selectively responsive to faces. Recent findings indicate that adjacent to the region where face- and object-selective cells have been recorded are neurons which respond to complex sounds including human and monkey vocalizations. Furthermore, when neurons in this same region are tested with combined face and voice communication stimuli, it is apparent that some cells in VLPFC are multisensory and respond to audiovisual stimuli. The determination that ventral prefrontal neurons are multisensory and responsive to auditory and visual communication stimuli may help to establish an animal model to assist in the investigation of the circuit and cellular basis of human communication. This will also aid in the understanding of general frontal lobe function and the processes that go awry in disorders including autism and schizophrenia, where disturbances in prefrontal function have been noted.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern theoretical accounts on reward-based learning are commonly based on reinforcement learning algorithms. Most noted in this context is the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm in which the difference between predicted and obtained reward, the prediction-error, serves as a learning signal. Consequently, larger rewards cause bigger prediction-errors and lead to faster learning than smaller rewards. Therefore, if animals employ a neural implementation of TD learning, reward-magnitude should affect learning in animals accordingly. Here we test this prediction by training pigeons on a simple color-discrimination task with two pairs of colors. In each pair, correct discrimination is rewarded; in pair one with a large-reward, in pair two with a small-reward. Pigeons acquired the 'large-reward' discrimination faster than the 'small-reward' discrimination. Animal behavior and an implementation of the TD-algorithm yielded comparable results with respect to the difference between learning curves in the large-reward and in the small-reward conditions. We conclude that the influence of reward-magnitude on the acquisition of a simple discrimination paradigm is accurately reflected by a TD implementation of reinforcement learning.},

  Abstract                 = {DANA is a python framework ( http://dana.loria.fr ) whose computational paradigm is grounded on the notion of a unit that is essentially a set of time dependent values varying under the influence of other units via adaptive weighted connections. The evolution of a unit's value are defined by a set of differential equations expressed in standard mathematical notation which greatly ease their definition. The units are organized into groups that form a model. Each unit can be connected to any other unit (including itself) using a weighted connection. The DANA framework offers a set of core objects needed to design and run such models. The modeler only has to define the equations of a unit as well as the equations governing the training of the connections. The simulation is completely transparent to the modeler and is handled by DANA. This allows DANA to be used for a wide range of numerical and distributed models as long as they fit the proposed framework (e.g. cellular automata, reaction-diffusion system, decentralized neural networks, recurrent neural networks, kernel-based image processing, etc.).},

We show how this can occur when a set of PFC-specific neural mechanisms interact with breadth of experience to self organize abstract rule-like PFC representations that support flexible generalization in novel tasks. The same model is shown to apply to benchmark PFC tasks (Stroop and Wisconsin card sorting), accurately simulating the behavior of neurologically intact and frontally damaged people.},

We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the performance of a spatial working memory task by humans. We distinguished the maintenance of spatial items from the selection of an item from memory to guide a response. Selection, but not maintenance, was associated with activation of prefrontal area 46 of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, maintenance was associated with activation of prefrontal area 8 and the intraparietal cortex. The results support a role for the dorsal prefrontal cortex in the selection of representations. This accounts for the fact that this area is activated both when subjects select between items on working memory tasks and when they freely select between movements on tasks of willed action.},

  Abstract                 = {The thalamus relays information to the cerebral cortex from subcortical centers or other cortices; in addition, it projects to the striatum and amygdala. The thalamic relay function is subject to modulation, so the flow of information to the target regions may change depending on behavioral demands. Modulation of thalamic relay by dopamine is not currently acknowledged, perhaps because dopamine innervation is reportedly scant in the rodent thalamus. We show that dopaminergic axons profusely target the human and macaque monkey thalamus using immunolabeling with three markers of the dopaminergic phenotype (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter). The dopamine innervation is especially prominent in specific association, limbic, and motor thalamic nuclei, where the densities of dopaminergic axons are as high as or higher than in the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation. We also identified the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the macaque thalamus using retrograde tract-tracing combined with immunohistochemistry. The origin of thalamic dopamine is multiple, and thus more complex, than in any other dopaminergic system defined to date: dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, ventral mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus project bilaterally to the monkey thalamus. We propose a novel dopaminergic system that targets the primate thalamus and is independent from the previously defined nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Investigating this "thalamic dopaminergic system" should further our understanding of higher brain functions and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.},

  Abstract                 = {A converging body of literature over the last 50 years has implicated the amygdala in assigning emotional significance or value to sensory information. In particular, the amygdala has been shown to be an essential component of the circuitry underlying fear-related responses. Disorders in the processing of fear-related information are likely to be the underlying cause of some anxiety disorders in humans such as posttraumatic stress. The amygdaloid complex is a group of more than 10 nuclei that are located in the midtemporal lobe. These nuclei can be distinguished both on cytoarchitectonic and connectional grounds. Anatomical tract tracing studies have shown that these nuclei have extensive intranuclear and internuclear connections. The afferent and efferent connections of the amygdala have also been mapped in detail, showing that the amygdaloid complex has extensive connections with cortical and subcortical regions. Analysis of fear conditioning in rats has suggested that long-term synaptic plasticity of inputs to the amygdala underlies the acquisition and perhaps storage of the fear memory. In agreement with this proposal, synaptic plasticity has been demonstrated at synapses in the amygdala in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In this review, we examine the anatomical and physiological substrates proposed to underlie amygdala function.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of our long-term memories of episodes or objects are organized so that we can retrieve them by association. Clinical neuropsychologists assess human memory by the paired-associate learning test, in which a series of paired words or figures is presented and the subject is then asked to retrieve the other pair member associated with each cue. Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment in this test. In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task using a set of computer-generated paired patterns. We found two types of task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex. One type selectively responded to both pictures of the paired associates. The other type, which had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation, exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of that picture was used as a cue. These results provide new evidence that single neurons acquire selectivity for visual patterns through associative learning. They also indicate neural mechanisms for storage and retrieval in the long-term memory of paired associates.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured human brain activity during the memory delay of a spatial working memory task with distraction. We found that, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the magnitude of activity sustained throughout the memory delay was significantly higher on correct trials than it was on error trials. By contrast, the magnitude of sustained activity in posterior areas did not differ between correct and error trials. The correlation of activity between posterior areas was, however, associated with correct memory performance after distraction. On the basis of these findings, we propose that memory representations gain resistance against distraction during a period of active maintenance within working memory. This may be mediated by interactions between prefrontal and posterior areas.},

The effects of damage to the hippocampus on these perirhinal-dependent feature-ambiguous tasks are, however, unknown. Prominent theories of medial temporal lobe function predict similar effects of perirhinal cortex and hippocampal lesions on cognitive tasks. In contrast, our hypothesis is that perirhinal cortex, and not the hippocampus, is important for nonspatial complex feature-ambiguous discriminations. We sought to distinguish between these competing theories in a straightforward way, by testing rhesus monkeys with hippocampal lesions on the same feature-ambiguous tasks shown previously to depend on perirhinal cortex. It was found that hippocampal lesions had no effects on any of these tasks. The findings support the perceptual-mnemonic/feature conjunction model of perirhinal cortex function, and provide further evidence for heterogeneity of function within the putative medial temporal lobe memory system.},

The orbitofrontal-ventral striatum loop is specialized for object-based value representation and target selection. The lateral prefrontal-anterior striatum loop is specialized for context-based value representation and context estimation.

This dichotomy has recently been linked to visual attentional phenomena by findings suggesting that 'subitizing' of small sets of objects is preattentive whereas 'counting' of over four items demands spatial shifts of attention. We evaluated this link at a neural level, using H2 15-O positron emission tomography to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow while subjects enumerated the number of target vertical bars that 'popped out' of a 16-bar visual display consisting of both horizontal and vertical bars. Relative to a condition with a single target, subitizing (one to four targets) activated foci in the occipital extrastriate cortex, consistent with involvement of early, preattentive visual processes. Relative to subitizing, counting (five to eight targets) activated a widespread network of brain regions, including multiple foci implicated in shifting visual attention-large regions of the superior parietal cortex bilaterally and a focus in the right inferior frontal cortex. These results offer the first direct neural support for mapping the subitizing-counting dichotomy onto separable processes mediating preattentive vision and shifts of visual attention.},

  Abstract                 = {To test the hypothesis that the basal ganglia are related to reward-oriented saccades, we examined activity of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons by using a one-direction-rewarded version of the memory-guided saccade task (1DR). Many SNr neurons changed (decreased or increased) their activity after and before a visual cue (post-cue and pre-cue activity). Post-cue decreases or increases tended to be larger to a contralateral cue. They were often modulated prospectively by the presence or absence of reward, either positively (enhanced in the rewarded condition) or negatively (enhanced in the nonrewarded condition). The positive reward modulation was more common among decreasing type neurons, whereas no such preference was observed among increasing type neurons. The reward-contingent decrease in SNr neuronal activity would facilitate rewarded saccades by inducing disinhibition in superior colliculus (SC) neurons. In contrast, the increase in SNr activity would suppress a saccade less selectively (rewarded or nonrewarded) by augmenting inhibition of SC neurons. The post-cue activity was often preceded by anticipatory pre-cue activity. Most typically, post-cue decrease was preceded by pre-cue decrease, selectively when the contralateral side was rewarded. This would reinforce the reward-oriented nature of SNr neuronal activity. The decreases and increases in SNr activity may be derived directly and indirectly, respectively, from the caudate (CD), where neurons show reward-contingent pre-cue and post-cue activity. These results suggest that the CD-SNr-SC mechanism would promote saccades oriented to reward.},

  Abstract                 = {Basal dendrites are a major target for synaptic inputs innervating cortical pyramidal neurons. At present little is known about signal processing in these fine dendrites. Here we show that coactivation of clustered neighbouring basal inputs initiated local dendritic spikes, which resulted in a 5.9 +/- 1.5 mV (peak) and 64.4 +/- 19.8 ms (half-width) cable-filtered voltage change at the soma that amplified the somatic voltage response by 226 +/- 46\%. These spikes were accompanied by large calcium transients restricted to the activated dendritic segment. In contrast to conventional sodium or calcium spikes, these spikes were mediated mostly by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels, which contributed at least 80\% of the total charge. The ionic mechanism of these NMDA spikes may allow 'dynamic spike-initiation zones', set by the spatial distribution of glutamate pre-bound to NMDA receptors, which in turn would depend on recent and ongoing activity in the cortical network. In addition, NMDA spikes may serve as a powerful mechanism for modification of the cortical network by inducing long-term strengthening of co-activated neighbouring inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease of the basal ganglia that causes severe motor, cognitive and emotional dysfunctions. In the human basal ganglia, these dysfunctions are accompanied by a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons, dysfunctions of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, and changes in dopamine receptor binding. Here, we used a neuro-computational model to investigate which of these basal ganglia dysfunctions can explain patients' deficits in different stimulus-response learning paradigms. We show that these paradigms are particularly suitable for scrutinising the effects of potential changes in dopamine signaling and of potential basal ganglia lesions on overt behavior in HD. We find that combined lesions of direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, but none of these lesions alone, reproduce patients' learning impairments. Degeneration of medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway accounts for patients' deficits in facilitating correct responses, whereas degeneration of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons explains their impairments in inhibiting dominant but incorrect responses. The empirical results cannot be explained by lesions of the subthalamic nucleus, which is part of the hyperdirect pathway, or by changes in dopamine levels. Overall, our simulations suggest combined lesions of direct and indirect pathways as a major source of HD patients' learning impairments and, tentatively, also their motor and cognitive deficits in general, whereas changes in dopamine levels are suggested to not be causally related to patients' impairments.},

Most of these models implement multiple distinct basal-ganglia pathways and assume them to fulfill different functions. As there is now a multitude of different models, it has become complex to keep track of their various, sometimes just marginally different assumptions on pathway functions. Moreover, it has become a challenge to oversee to what extent individual assumptions are corroborated or challenged by empirical data. Focusing on computational, but also considering non-computational models, we review influential concepts of pathway functions and show to what extent they are compatible with or contradict each other. Moreover, we outline how empirical evidence favors or challenges specific model assumptions and propose experiments that allow testing assumptions against each other.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to learn associations between stimuli, responses and rewards is a prerequisite for survival. Models of reinforcement learning suggest that the striatum, a basal ganglia input nucleus, vitally contributes to these learning processes. Our recently presented computational model predicts, first, that not only the striatum, but also the globus pallidus contributes to the learning (i.e., exploration) of stimulus-response associations based on rewards. Secondly, it predicts that the stable execution (i.e., exploitation) of well-learned associations involves further learning in the thalamus. To test these predictions, we postoperatively recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from patients that had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation to treat severe movement disorders. Macroelectrodes were placed either in the globus pallidus or in the ventral thalamus. During recordings, patients performed a reward-based stimulus-response learning task that comprised periods of exploration and exploitation. We analyzed correlations between patients' LFP amplitudes and model-based estimates of their reward expectations and reward prediction errors. In line with our first prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during the presentation of rewards and reward omissions correlated with patients' reward prediction errors, suggesting pallidal access to reward-based teaching signals. Unexpectedly, the same was true for the thalamus. In further support of this prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during stimulus presentation correlated with patients' reward expectations during phases of low reward certainty - suggesting pallidal participation in the learning of stimulus-response associations. In line with our second prediction, correlations between thalamic stimulus-related LFP amplitudes and patients' reward expectations were significant within phases of already high reward certainty, suggesting thalamic participation in exploitation.},

  Abstract                 = {In Parkinson's disease, a loss of dopamine neurons causes severe motor impairments. These motor impairments have long been thought to result exclusively from immediate effects of dopamine loss on neuronal firing in basal ganglia, causing imbalances of basal ganglia pathways. However, motor impairments and pathway imbalances may also result from dysfunctional synaptic plasticity - a novel concept of how Parkinsonian symptoms evolve. Here we built a neuro-computational model that allows us to simulate the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity in basal ganglia. Our simulations confirm that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity can indeed explain the emergence of both motor impairments and pathway imbalances in Parkinson's disease, thus corroborating the novel concept. By predicting that dysfunctional plasticity results not only in reduced activation of desired responses, but also in their active inhibition, our simulations provide novel testable predictions. When simulating dopamine replacement therapy (which is a standard treatment in clinical practice), we observe a new balance of pathway outputs, rather than a simple restoration of non-Parkinsonian states. In addition, high doses of replacement are shown to result in overshooting motor activity, in line with empirical evidence. Finally, our simulations provide an explanation for the intensely debated paradox that focused basal ganglia lesions alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, but do not impair performance in healthy animals. Overall, our simulations suggest that the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity play an essential role in the development of Parkinsonian symptoms, thus arguing for a re-conceptualisation of Parkinsonian pathophysiology.},

We present a biologically meaningful computational model of how these loops contribute to the organization of working memory and the development of response behavior. Via reinforcement learning in basal ganglia, the model develops flexible control of working memory within prefrontal loops and achieves selection of appropriate responses based on working memory content and visual stimulation within a motor loop. We show that both working memory control and response selection can evolve within parallel and interacting cortico-basalganglio-thalamic loops by Hebbian and three-factor learning rules. Furthermore, the model gives a coherent explanation for how complex strategies of working memory control and response selection can derive from basic cognitive operations that can be learned via trial and error.},

  Abstract                 = {The present investigation had two aims: (1) to study responses of dopamine neurons to stimuli with attentional and motivational significance during several steps of learning a behavioral task, and (2) to study the activity of dopamine neurons during the performance of cognitive tasks known to be impaired after lesions of these neurons. Monkeys that had previously learned a simple reaction time task were trained to perform a spatial delayed response task via two intermediate tasks. During the learning of each new task, a total of 25\% of 76 dopamine neurons showed phasic responses to the delivery of primary liquid reward, whereas only 9\% of 163 neurons responded to this event once task performance was established. This produced an average population response during but not after learning of each task. Reward responses during learning were significantly more numerous and pronounced in area A10, as compared to areas A8 and A9. Dopamine neurons also showed phasic responses to the two conditioned stimuli. These were the instruction cue, which was the first stimulus in each trial and indicated the target of the upcoming arm movement (58\% of 76 neurons during and 44\% of 163 neurons after learning), and the trigger stimulus, which was a conditioned incentive stimulus predicting reward and eliciting a saccadic eye movement and an arm reaching movement (38\% of neurons during and 40\% after learning). None of the dopamine neurons showed sustained activity in the delay between the instruction and trigger stimuli that would resemble the activity of neurons in dopamine terminal areas, such as the striatum and frontal cortex. Thus, dopamine neurons respond phasically to alerting external stimuli with behavioral significance whose detection is crucial for learning and performing delayed response tasks. The lack of sustained activity suggests that dopamine neurons do not encode representational processes, such as working memory, expectation of external stimuli or reward, or preparation of movement. Rather, dopamine neurons are involved with transient changes of impulse activity in basic attentional and motivational processes underlying learning and cognitive behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Projections from cortical and subcortical limbic structures to the basal ganglia are predominantly directed to the ventral striatum. The present study investigated how the expectation of external events with behavioral significance is reflected in the activity of ventral striatal neurons. A total of 420 neurons were studied in macaque monkeys performing in a delayed go-no-go task. Lights of different colors instructed the animal to do an arm-reaching movement or refrain from moving, respectively, when a trigger light was illuminated a few seconds later. Task performance was reinforced by liquid reward in both situations. A total of 60 ventral striatal neurons showed sustained increases of activity before the occurrence of individual task events. In 43 of these neurons, activations specifically preceded the delivery of reward, independent of the movement or no-movement reaction. In a series of additional tests, these activations were time locked to the subsequent reward, disappeared within a few trials when reward was omitted, and were temporally unrelated to mouth movements. Changes in the appetitive value of the reward liquid modified the magnitude of activations, suggesting a possible relationship to the hedonic properties of the expected event. Activations also occurred when reward was delivered in a predictable manner outside of any behavioral task. These data suggest that neurons in the ventral striatum are activated during states of expectation of individual environmental events that are predictable to the subject through its past experience. The prevalence of activations related to the expectation of reward suggests that ventral striatal neurons have access to central representations of reward and thereby participate in the processing of information underlying the motivational control of goal-directed behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Associative learning enables animals to anticipate the occurrence of important outcomes. Learning occurs when the actual outcome differs from the predicted outcome, resulting in a prediction error. Neurons in several brain structures appear to code prediction errors in relation to rewards, punishments, external stimuli, and behavioral reactions. In one form, dopamine neurons, norepinephrine neurons, and nucleus basalis neurons broadcast prediction errors as global reinforcement or teaching signals to large postsynaptic structures. In other cases, error signals are coded by selected neurons in the cerebellum, superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, parietal cortex, striatum, and visual system, where they influence specific subgroups of neurons. Prediction errors can be used in postsynaptic structures for the immediate selection of behavior or for synaptic changes underlying behavioral learning. The coding of prediction errors may represent a basic mode of brain function that may also contribute to the processing of sensory information and the short-term control of behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Mesocortical [corrected] dopamine (DA) inputs to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play a critical role in normal cognitive process and neuropsychiatic pathologies. This DA input regulates aspects of working memory function, planning and attention, and its dysfunctions may underlie positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Despite intense research, there is still a lack of clear understanding of the basic principles of actions of DA in the PFC. In recent years, there has been considerable efforts by many groups to understand the cellular mechanisms of DA modulation of PFC neurons. However, the results of these efforts often lead to contradictions and controversies. One principal feature of DA that is agreed by most researchers is that DA is a neuromodulator and is clearly not an excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter. The present article aims to identify certain principles of DA mechanisms by drawing on published, as well as unpublished data from PFC and other CNS sites to shed light on aspects of DA neuromodulation and address some of the existing controversies. Eighteen key features about DA modulation have been identified. These points directly impact on the end result of DA neuromodulation, and in some cases explain why DA does not yield identical effects under all experimental conditions. It will become apparent that DA's actions in PFC are subtle and depend on a variety of factors that can no longer be ignored. Some of these key factors include distinct bell-shaped dose-response profiles of postsynaptic DA effects, different postsynaptic responses that are contingent on the duration of DA receptor stimulation, prolonged duration effects, bidirectional effects following activation of D1 and D2 classes of receptors and membrane potential state and history dependence of subsequent DA actions. It is hoped that these factors will be borne in mind in future research and as a result a more consistent picture of DA neuromodulation in the PFC will emerge. Based on these factors, a theory is proposed for DA's action in PFC. This theory suggests that DA acts to expand or contract the breadth of information held in working memory buffers in PFC networks.},

The second aspect of categorization discussed is the selection of appropriate actions or behaviors on the basis of category membership, and the role of the visual corticostriatal loop output and the motor corticostriatal loop, which connects motor planning areas with the putamen, in action selection. The third aspect of categorization discussed is how categories are learned with the aid of feedback linked dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia. These projections underlie corticostriatal synaptic plasticity across the basal ganglia, and also serve as input to the executive and motivational corticostriatal loops that play a role in strategic use of feedback.},

Habit learning has been studied in many different fields of neuroscience using different species, tasks, and methodologies, and as a result it has taken on a wide range of definitions from these various perspectives. We identify five common but not universal, definitional features of habit learning: that it is inflexible, slow or incremental, unconscious, automatic, and insensitive to reinforcer devaluation. We critically evaluate for each of these how it has been defined, its utility for research in both humans and non-human animals, and the evidence that it serves as an accurate description of basal ganglia function. In conclusion, we propose a multi-faceted approach to habit learning and its relationship to the basal ganglia, emphasizing the need for formal definitions that will provide directions for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Anterograde tracing methods were used to examine the topographic organization and interrelationship of projections to the neostriatum arising from various areas of association cortex. In contrast to the currently accepted topographic schema, all cortical areas examined project to longitudinal territories that occupy restricted medial-lateral domains of the neostriatum. The posterior parietal and superior arcuate cortices project to dorsolateral portions of the neostriatum; the dorsolateral and dorsomedial frontal cortices project centrally; and the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal projections are distributed to ventromedial regions of the caudate nucleus and putamen. In coronal section, cortical terminal fields form a diagonal strip, extending from the dorsal, ventricular border of the caudate nucleus, through the fiber bundles of the internal capsule, to the ventral margin of the putamen. Double labeling studies, in which two cortical areas were injected in the same animal, indicated that convergence of input within neostriatal domains is not governed by reciprocity of corticocortical connectivity. Thus, the interrelationship of projections arising from connectionally linked cortical areas ranged from nearly complete segregation of terminal fields (e.g., from dorsolateral prefrontal and orbital cortices) to extensive overlap of terminal domains (e.g., from frontal and temporal cortices). In the latter case, detailed analysis revealed that frontal and temporal terminals actually were interdigitated rather than intermixed within the zone of overlap. The present findings suggest a new conceptualization of corticostriatal topography in the primate which emphasizes the longitudinal arrangement of cortical terminal domains. Additionally, these findings provide a map for functional parcellation of the neostriatum on the basis of its cortical innervation which may prove useful to understanding normal striatal function, as well as the symptomatology associated with neostriatal injury and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasingly strong evidence suggests that cholinergic neurons in the mesopontine tegmentum play important roles in the control of wakefulness and sleep. To understand better how the activity of these neurons is regulated, the potential afferent connections of the laterodorsal (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT) were investigated in the rat. This was accomplished by using retrograde and anterograde axonal transport methods and NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was also used to identify the transmitter content of some of the retrogradely identified afferents. Following injections of the retrograde tracer wheatgerm agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into either the LDT or the PPT, labelled neurons were seen in a number of limbic forebrain structures. The medial prefrontal cortex and lateral habenula contained more retrogradely labelled neurons from the LDT, whereas in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala, more cells were labelled from the PPT. Moderate numbers of neurons were seen in the magnocellular regions of the basal forebrain, and many labelled neurons were observed in the lateral hypothalamus, the zona incerta, and the midbrain central gray from both the LDT and the PPT. Accessory oculomotor nuclei in the midbrain as well as eye movement-related structures in the lower brainstem contained some neurons labelled from the LDT, and fewer neurons from the PPT. A few labelled neurons were seen in somatosensory and other sensory relay nuclei in the brainstem and the spinal cord. Retrograde labelling was seen in a number of extrapyramidal structures, including the globus pallidus, entopenduncular and subthalamic nuclei, and substantia nigra following PPT injections; with LDT injections, labelling was similar in density in the substantia nigra but virtually absent in the entopeduncular and subthalamic nuclei. Data with the fluorescent retrograde tracer fluorogold combined with immunofluorescence indicated that many neurons in the zona incerta-lateral hypothalamic region that were retrogradely labelled from the LDT contained alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Numerous neurons were labelled throughout the reticular formation of the brainstem following either LDT or PPT injections. Many neurons retrogradely labelled in the LDT and PPT, the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and the locus ceruleus contained choline acetyltransferase, serotonin, and tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively. The anterograde tracers WGA-HRP and phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were used to confirm some of the projections indicated by the retrograde labelling data; anterograde labelling was seen in the LDT and PPT following injections of one of these tracers into the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral hypothalamus, and the contralateral LDT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Many of the brain's reward systems converge on the nucleus accumbens, a region richly innervated by excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferents representing the circuitry necessary for selecting adaptive motivated behaviors. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus provides contextual and spatial information, the basolateral amygdala conveys affective influence, and the prefrontal cortex provides an integrative impact on goal-directed behavior. The balance of these afferents is under the modulatory influence of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. This midbrain region receives its own complex mix of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, some of which have only recently been identified. Such afferent regulation positions the dopamine system to bias goal-directed behavior based on internal drives and environmental contingencies. Conditions that result in reward promote phasic dopamine release, which serves to maintain ongoing behavior by selectively potentiating ventral subicular drive to the accumbens. Behaviors that fail to produce an expected reward decrease dopamine transmission, which favors prefrontal cortical-driven switching to new behavioral strategies. As such, the limbic reward system is designed to optimize action plans for maximizing reward outcomes. This system can be commandeered by drugs of abuse or psychiatric disorders, resulting in inappropriate behaviors that sustain failed reward strategies.

Because these receptors are restricted to two distinct MSN populations, this postulate demands that synaptic plasticity be unidirectional in each cell type. Using brain slices from DA receptor transgenic mice, we show that this is not the case. Rather, DA plays complementary roles in these two types of MSN to ensure that synaptic plasticity is bidirectional and Hebbian. In models of Parkinson's disease, this system is thrown out of balance, leading to unidirectional changes in plasticity that could underlie network pathology and symptoms.},

  Abstract                 = {Cortical neurons in vivo had been regarded as Poisson spike generators that convey no information other than the rate of random firing. Recently, using a metric for analyzing local variation of interspike intervals, researchers have found that individual neurons express specific patterns in generating spikes, which may symbolically be termed regular, random, or bursty, rather invariantly in time. In order to study the dynamics of firing patterns in greater detail, we propose here a Bayesian method for estimating firing irregularity and the firing rate simultaneously for a given spike sequence, and we implement an algorithm that may render the empirical Bayesian estimation practicable for data comprising a large number of spikes. Application of this method to electrophysiological data revealed a subtle correlation between the degree of firing irregularity and the firing rate for individual neurons. Irregularity of firing did not deviate greatly around the low degree of dependence on the firing rate and remained practically unchanged for individual neurons in the cortical areas V1 and MT, whereas it fluctuated greatly in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This indicates the presence and absence of autocontrolling mechanisms for maintaining patterns of firing in the cortex and thalamus, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of the present work was to define the mechanisms underlying the contribution of sensory and limbic cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops to visual processing and its attentional modulation. We proposed that visual processing is promoted by dopamine-dependent long-term modifications of synaptic transmission in the basal ganglia that favour a selection of neocortical patterns representing a visual stimulus. This selection is the result of the opposite sign of modulation of strong and weak cortico-basal ganglia inputs and subsequent activity reorganization in each loop. Reorganization leads to disinhibition/inhibition of cortical neurons strongly/weakly excited by stimulus during dopamine release. Recruitment of the thalamo-basal ganglia-collicular pathway is proposed to be necessary for stimulus-evoked dopamine release that underlies bottom-up attentional effects. Visual excitation of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (via the thalamus), their cooperation in control of the basal ganglia and dopaminergic cell firing, and simultaneous modulation of activity in diverse cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops is proposed to underlie top-down attentional effects. It follows from our model that only those components of cortical responses can be modulated by attention, whose onset exceeds the latency of visual responses of dopaminergic cells (50-110ms). This and other consequences of the model are in accordance with known experimental data.}

  Abstract                 = {We show that simple assumptions about neural processing lead to a model of interval timing as a temporal integration process, in which a noisy firing-rate representation of time rises linearly on average toward a response threshold over the course of an interval. Our assumptions include: that neural spike trains are approximately independent Poisson processes, that correlations among them can be largely cancelled by balancing excitation and inhibition, that neural populations can act as integrators, and that the objective of timed behavior is maximal accuracy and minimal variance. The model accounts for a variety of physiological and behavioral findings in rodents, monkeys, and humans, including ramping firing rates between the onset of reward-predicting cues and the receipt of delayed rewards, and universally scale-invariant response time distributions in interval timing tasks. It furthermore makes specific, well-supported predictions about the skewness of these distributions, a feature of timing data that is usually ignored. The model also incorporates a rapid (potentially one-shot) duration-learning procedure. Human behavioral data support the learning rule's predictions regarding learning speed in sequences of timed responses. These results suggest that simple, integration-based models should play as prominent a role in interval timing theory as they do in theories of perceptual decision making, and that a common neural mechanism may underlie both types of behavior.},

A visual perception framework is proposed to identify cortical regions associated with modality-specific processing (i.e., visual, auditory, motor, or olfactory), visual domain-specific processing (i.e., "what" versus "where," or face versus visual context), and visual feature-specific processing (i.e., color, motion, or spatial location). Independent assessments of visual item memory studies and visual working memory studies revealed activity in the appropriate cortical regions associated with each of the three levels of visual perception processing. These results provide compelling evidence that visual memory and visual perception are associated with common neural substrates. Furthermore, as with visual perception, they support the view that visual memory is a constructive process, in which features or components from disparate cortical regions bind together to form a coherent whole.},

Several interpretations of prediction error have been offered, including the model-free reinforcement learning method known as temporal difference learning (TD), and the important Rescorla-Wagner (RW) learning rule. Here, we present a model-based adaptation of these ideas that provides a good account of empirical data pertaining to dopamine neuron firing patterns and associative learning paradigms such as latent inhibition, Kamin blocking and overshadowing. Our departure from model-free reinforcement learning also offers: 1) a parsimonious distinction between tonic and phasic dopamine functions; 2) a potential generalization of the role of phasic dopamine from valence-dependent "reward" processing to valence-independent "salience" processing; 3) an explanation for the selectivity of certain dopamine manipulations on motivation for distal rewards; and 4) a plausible link between formal notions of prediction error and accounts of disturbances of thought in schizophrenia (in which dopamine dysfunction is strongly implicated). The model distinguishes itself from existing accounts by offering novel predictions pertaining to the firing of dopamine neurons in various untested behavioral scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years the ventral pallidum has become a focus of great research interest as a mechanism of reward and incentive motivation. As a major output for limbic signals, the ventral pallidum was once associated primarily with motor functions rather than regarded as a reward structure in its own right. However, ample evidence now suggests that ventral pallidum function is a major mechanism of reward in the brain. We review data indicating that (1) an intact ventral pallidum is necessary for normal reward and motivation, (2) stimulated activation of ventral pallidum is sufficient to cause reward and motivation enhancements, and (3) activation patterns in ventral pallidum neurons specifically encode reward and motivation signals via phasic bursts of excitation to incentive and hedonic stimuli. We conclude that the ventral pallidum may serve as an important 'limbic final common pathway' for mesocorticolimbic processing of many rewards.},

  Abstract                 = {Each of our movements activates our own sensory receptors, and therefore keeping track of self-movement is a necessary part of analysing sensory input. One way in which the brain keeps track of self-movement is by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor commands. This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore saccade-induced visual changes. The critical missing link has been the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing. Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus, neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal eye field. In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades. We tested the hypothesis that these two components-a pathway for corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields-form a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying corollary discharge in other sensory systems.},

STDP strengthens synapses that receive correlated input, which can lead to the formation of stimulus-selective columns and the development, refinement, and maintenance of selectivity maps in network models. The temporal asymmetry of STDP suppresses strong destabilizing self-excitatory loops and allows a group of neurons that become selective early in development to direct other neurons to become similarly selective. STDP, acting alone without further hypothetical global constraints or additional forms of plasticity, can also reproduce the remapping seen in adult cortex following afferent lesions.},

One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

During reward conditioning, the model learns to generate tonic and phasic signals that represent predictions and prediction errors, including precisely timed negative signals if expected rewards are omitted or delayed. We test the robot's learning and behavior in different environmental contexts and observe changes in the development of the neuromodulatory system that depend upon environmental factors. Simulation of a computational model incorporating both reward-related and aversive stimuli leads to the emergence of conditioned reward and aversive behaviors.

A full specification of such a network model includes a description of the dynamics and state changes of neurons and synapses, as well as the synaptic connectivity patterns and the initial values of all parameters. A standard approach in neuronal modeling software is to build network models based on a library of pre-defined components and mechanisms; if a model component does not yet exist, it has to be defined in a special-purpose or general low-level language and potentially be compiled and linked with the simulator. Here we propose an alternative approach that allows flexible definition of models by writing textual descriptions based on mathematical notation. We demonstrate that this approach allows the definition of a wide range of models with minimal syntax. Furthermore, such explicit model descriptions allow the generation of executable code for various target languages and devices, since the description is not tied to an implementation. Finally, this approach also has advantages for readability and reproducibility, because the model description is fully explicit, and because it can be automatically parsed and transformed into formatted descriptions. The presented approach has been implemented in the Brian2 simulator.},

The system directs the transmission of cortical signals between pairs of regions by manipulating separately the selection of sources and destinations of information transfers. We suggest that such a mechanism provides an account for several cognitive functions of the basal ganglia. The model also incorporates a possible mechanism by which subsequent transfers of information control the release of dopamine. This signal is used to produce novel stimulus-response associations by internalizing transferred cortical representations in the striatum. We discuss how the model is related to production systems and cognitive architectures. A series of simulations is presented to illustrate how the model can perform simple stimulus-response tasks, develop automatic behaviors, and provide an account of impairments in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in mediating different forms of decision making in humans and animals. In the present study, we observed that inactivation of the rat NAc, via infusion of GABA agonists, reduced preference for a large/risky option and increased response latencies on a probabilistic discounting task. Discrete inactivations of the NAc shell and core revealed further differences between these regions in mediating choice and response latencies, respectively. The effect on choice was attributable to reduced win-stay performance (i.e., choosing risky after a being rewarded for a risky choice on a preceding trial). Moreover, NAc inactivation altered choice only when the large/risky option had greater long-term value, in terms of the amount of food that could be obtained over multiple trials relative to the small/certain option. Inactivation of the NAc or the shell subregion also slightly reduced preference for larger rewards on a reward magnitude discrimination. Thus, the NAc seems to play a small role in biasing choice toward larger rewards, but its contribution to behavior is amplified when delivery of these rewards is uncertain, helping to direct response selection toward more favorable outcomes.},

Whereas dopamine neurons are phasically activated by reward-predictive stimuli, anticipatory activity of cortical and striatal neurons is increased during delay periods before important events. Characteristics of dopamine neuron activity resemble those of the prediction error signal of the temporal difference (TD) model of Pavlovian learning (Sutton \& Barto, 1990). This study demonstrates that the prediction signal of the TD model reproduces characteristics of cortical and striatal anticipatory neural activity. This finding suggests that tonic anticipatory activities may reflect prediction signals that are involved in the processing of dopamine neuron activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopamine shapes a wide variety of psychomotor functions. This is mainly accomplished by modulating cortical and thalamic glutamatergic signals impinging upon principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine D1 receptor signaling enhances dendritic excitability and glutamatergic signaling in striatonigral MSNs, whereas D2 receptor signaling exerts the opposite effect in striatopallidal MSNs. The functional antagonism between these two major striatal dopamine receptors extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies, using transgenic mice in which cells express D1 and D2 receptors, have uncovered unappreciated differences between MSNs that shape glutamatergic signaling and the influence of DA on synaptic plasticity. These studies have also shown that long-term alterations in dopamine signaling produce profound and cell-type-specific reshaping of corticostriatal connectivity and function.},

  Abstract                 = {The striatum, the input stage of the basal ganglia, is a critical brain structure for the learning of stimulus-response habits as well as motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills. Roles of dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) in this form of implicit memory have long been considered essential, but the underlying cellular mechanism is still unclear. By means of patch-clamp recordings from corticostriatal slices of the mouse, we studied whether the identified striatal cholinergic interneurons undergo long-term synaptic changes after tetanic stimulation of cortico- and thalamostriatal fibers. Electrical stimulation of the fibers revealed a depolarizing and hyperpolarizing postsynaptic potential in the striatal cholinergic interneurons. The early depolarizing phase was considered to be a cortico/thalamostriatal glutamatergic EPSP, and the hyperpolarizing component was considered to be an intrastriatally evoked GABAergic IPSP. Tetanic stimulation of cortico/thalamostriatal fibers was found to induce simultaneously occurring long-term potentiation (LTP) of the EPSPs as well as the disynaptically mediated IPSPs. The induction of LTP of EPSP required a rise in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and dopamine D(5), but not D(2) receptor activation. Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors might also play a part in the LTP induction. Blockade of NMDA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors, or serotonin receptors had no significant effects. The long-term enhancement of the disynaptic IPSPs was caused by a long-term increase in the occurrence rate but not the amplitude of disynaptically mediated IPSP in the striatal cholinergic interneurons.

  Abstract                 = {Neuropsychological studies have recently demonstrated that the macaque monkey perirhinal (areas 35 and 36) and parahippocampal (areas TH and TF) cortices contribute importantly to normal memory function. Unfortunately, neuroanatomical information concerning the cytoarchitectonic organization and extrinsic connectivity of these cortical regions is meager. We investigated the organization of cortical inputs to the macaque monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices by placing discrete injections of the retrograde tracers fast blue, diamidino yellow, and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase throughout these areas. We found that the macaque monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices receive different complements of cortical inputs. The major cortical inputs to the perirhinal cortex arise from the unimodal visual areas TE and rostral TEO and from area TF of the parahippocampal cortex. The perirhinal cortex also receives projections from the dysgranular and granular subdivisions of the insular cortex and from area 13 of the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, area TF of the parahippocampal cortex receives its strongest input from more caudal visual areas V4, TEO, and caudal TE, as well as prominent inputs from polymodal association cortices, including the retrosplenial cortex and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Area TF also receives projections from areas 7a and LIP of the posterior parietal lobe, insular cortex, and areas 46, 13, 45, and 9 of the frontal lobe. As with area TF, area TH receives substantial projections from the retrosplenial cortex as well as moderate projections from the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus; unlike area TF, area TH receives almost no innervation from areas TE and TEO. It does, however, receive relatively strong inputs from auditory association areas on the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus.},

  Abstract                 = {Lesions of the entorhinal cortex in humans, monkeys, and rats impair memory for a variety of kinds of information, including memory for objects and places. To begin to understand the contribution of entorhinal cells to different forms of memory, responses of entorhinal cells were recorded as monkeys performed either an object or place memory task. The object memory task was a variation of delayed matching to sample. A sample picture was presented at the start of the trial, followed by a variable sequence of zero to four test pictures, ending with a repetition of the sample (i.e., a match). The place memory task was a variation of delayed matching to place. In this task, a cue stimulus was presented at a variable sequence of one to four "places" on a computer screen, ending with a repetition of one of the previously shown places (i.e., a match). For both tasks, the animals were rewarded for releasing a bar to the match. To solve these tasks, the monkey must 1) discriminate the stimuli, 2) maintain a memory of the appropriate stimuli during the course of the trial, and 3) evaluate whether a test stimulus matches previously presented stimuli. The responses of entorhinal cortex neurons were consistent with a role in all three of these processes in both tasks. We found that 47\% and 55\% of the visually responsive entorhinal cells responded selectively to the different objects or places presented during the object or place task, respectively. Similar to previous findings in prefrontal but not perirhinal cortex on the object task, some entorhinal cells had sample-specific delay activity that was maintained throughout all of the delay intervals in the sequence. For the place task, some cells had location-specific maintained activity in the delay immediately following a specific cue location. In addition, 59\% and 22\% of the visually responsive cells recorded during the object and place task, respectively, responded differently to the test stimuli according to whether they were matching or non-matching to the stimuli held in memory. Responses of some cells were enhanced to matching stimuli, whereas others were suppressed. This suppression or enhancement typically occurred well before the animals' behavioral response, suggesting that this information could be used to perform the task. These results indicate that entorhinal cells receive sensory information about both objects and spatial locations and that their activity carries information about objects and locations held in short-term memory.},

It is hypothesized that there are neurons that encode expected reward values to modulate impending actions and potentially represent motivation signals. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the ventral pallidum (VP) may participate in this process. We recorded single neuronal activity in the monkey VP using a saccade task with a direction-dependent reward bias. Depending on the amount of the expected reward, VP neurons increased or decreased their activity tonically until the reward was delivered, for both ipsiversive and contraversive saccades. Changes in expected reward values were also associated with changes in saccade performance (latency and velocity). Furthermore, bilateral muscimol-induced inactivation of the VP abolished the reward-dependent changes in saccade latencies. These data suggest that the VP provides expected reward value signals that are used to facilitate or inhibit motor actions.},

In the present study, we investigated the extent to which corticostriatal input zones from the primary motor cortex (MI), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the premotor cortex (PM) of the macaque monkey might overlap in the putamen. Intracortical microstimulation was performed to map the MI, SMA, and dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) divisions of the PM. Then, two different anterograde tracers were injected separately into somatotopically corresponding regions of two given areas of the MI, SMA, PMd, and PMv. With respect to the PMd and PMv, tracer injections were centered on their forelimb representations. Corticostriatal input zones from hindlimb, forelimb, and orofacial representations of the MI and SMA were, in this order, arranged from dorsal to ventral within the putamen. Dense input zones from the MI were located predominantly in the lateral aspect of the putamen, whereas those from the SMA were in the medial aspect of the putamen. On the other hand, corticostriatal inputs from forelimb representations of the PMd and PMv were distributed mainly in the dorsomedial sector of the putamen. Thus, the corticostriatal input zones from the MI and SMA were considerably segregated though partly overlapped in the mediolateral central aspect of the putamen, while the corticostriatal input zone from the PM largely overlapped that from the SMA, but not from the MI.},

For each neuron, information about each stimulus conveyed by the delay activity was estimated as a coefficient of multiple regression analysis. We found that target information derived from long-term memory (LTM) persisted despite the distractors. By contrast, cue information derived from the visual system was attenuated and frequently replaced by distractor information. These results suggest that LTM-derived information required for upcoming behavior is actively maintained in the IT neurons, whereas visually derived information tends to be updated irrespective of behavioral relevance.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were found to exhibit sustained responses related to reward uncertainty, in addition to the phasic responses related to reward-prediction errors (RPEs). Thus, cue-dependent anticipations of the timing, magnitude, and uncertainty of rewards are learned and reflected in components of DA signals. Here we simulate a local circuit model to show how learned uncertainty responses are generated, along with phasic RPE responses, on single trials. Both types of simulated DA responses exhibit the empirically observed dependencies on conditional probability, expected value of reward, and time since onset of the reward-predicting cue. The model's three major pathways compute expected values of cues, timed predictions of reward magnitudes, and uncertainties associated with these predictions. The first two pathways' computations refine those modeled by Brown et al. (1999). The third, newly modeled, pathway involves medium spiny projection neurons (MSPNs) of the striatal matrix, whose axons corelease GABA and substance P, both at synapses with GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and with distal dendrites (in SNr) of DA neurons whose somas are located in ventral SNc. Corelease enables efficient computation of uncertainty responses that are a nonmonotonic function of the conditional probability of reward, and variability in striatal cholinergic transmission can explain observed individual differences in the amplitudes of uncertainty responses. The involvement of matricial MSPNs and cholinergic transmission within the striatum implies a relation between uncertainty in cue-reward contingencies and action-selection functions of the basal ganglia.},

We have also found, by training adult monkeys for discrimination of a specific set of shapes, that such a long-term training increases the proportion of TE cells responding to the shapes used in the training even in the adult.

Despite their prevalence in clinical populations, underlying mechanisms associated with the development of these behaviors remain poorly understood. We examined the role of the indirect basal ganglia pathway in the development of stereotypy using deer mice. We measured neuronal metabolic activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and other relevant brain regions using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry at three developmental time-points. Although no differences were observed in STN across development, significant differences were found when mice were grouped by developmental trajectory. At 6 weeks post-weaning, significantly lower CO activity in STN was found in those trajectory groups that developed high levels of repetitive behavior versus the trajectory group that did not, suggesting the development of stereotypy is associated with decreased indirect basal ganglia pathway activity. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that preferential activation of striatal striosomes relative to surrounding matrix would be associated with the development of stereotypy. No differences in the relative activation of these striatal compartments were observed across development or among trajectory groups. Our results point to dynamic changes in the indirect pathway associated with the development of repetitive behavior and extends our prior work linking reduced indirect pathway activation to stereotypy in adult deer mice.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of objects in the world is stored in our brains as rich, multimodal representations. Because the neural pathways that process this diverse sensory information are largely anatomically distinct, a fundamental challenge to cognitive neuroscience is to explain how the brain binds the different sensory features that comprise an object to form meaningful, multimodal object representations. Studies with nonhuman primates suggest that a structure at the culmination of the object recognition system (the perirhinal cortex) performs this critical function. In contrast, human neuroimaging studies implicate the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The results of the functional MRI study reported here resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that both pSTS and the perirhinal cortex contribute to crossmodal binding in humans, but in different ways. Significantly, only perirhinal cortex activity is modulated by meaning variables (e.g., semantic congruency and semantic category), suggesting that these two regions play complementary functional roles, with pSTS acting as a presemantic, heteromodal region for crossmodal perceptual features, and perirhinal cortex integrating these features into higher-level conceptual representations. This interpretation is supported by the results of our behavioral study: Patients with lesions, including the perirhinal cortex, but not patients with damage restricted to frontal cortex, were impaired on the same crossmodal integration task, and their performance was significantly influenced by the same semantic factors, mirroring the functional MRI findings. These results integrate nonhuman and human primate research by providing converging evidence that human perirhinal cortex is also critically involved in processing meaningful aspects of multimodal object representations.},

  Abstract                 = {There are two distinct inhibitory GABAergic circuits in the neostriatum. The feedforward circuit consists of a relatively small population of GABAergic interneurons that receives excitatory input from the neocortex and exerts monosynaptic inhibition onto striatal spiny projection neurons. The feedback circuit comprises the numerous spiny projection neurons and their interconnections via local axon collaterals. This network has long been assumed to provide the majority of striatal GABAergic inhibition and to sharpen and shape striatal output through lateral inhibition, producing increased activity in the most strongly excited spiny cells at the expense of their less strongly excited neighbors. Recent results, mostly from recording experiments of synaptically connected pairs of neurons, have revealed that the two GABAergic circuits differ markedly in terms of the total number of synapses made by each, the strength of the postsynaptic response detected at the soma, the extent of presynaptic convergence and divergence and the net effect of the activation of each circuit on the postsynaptic activity of the spiny neuron. These data have revealed that the feedforward inhibition is powerful and widespread, with spiking in a single interneuron being capable of significantly delaying or even blocking the generation of spikes in a large number of postsynaptic spiny neurons. In contrast, the postsynaptic effects of spiking in a single presynaptic spiny neuron on postsynaptic spiny neurons are weak when measured at the soma, and unable to significantly affect spike timing or generation. Further, reciprocity of synaptic connections between spiny neurons is only rarely observed. These results suggest that the bulk of the fast inhibition that has the strongest effects on spiny neuron spike timing comes from the feedforward interneuronal system whereas the axon collateral feedback system acts principally at the dendrites to control local excitability as well as the overall level of activity of the spiny neuron.},

  Abstract                 = {The cerebellum and its associated circuitry constitutes the entire essential neuronal system for classical conditioning of eye-blink and other discrete responses (e.g. limb flexion) learned with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) using the standard delay paradigm where the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the US coterminate. Evidence reviewed here strongly supports the following conclusions. The CS pathway involves sensory relay nuclei projections to the pontine nuclei and its mossy fiber projections to the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. The US pathway involves activation of the inferior olive (dorsal accessory olive for eye blink) and its climbing fiber projections to the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. The conditioned response (CR) pathway involves the cerebellar interpositus nucleus, the superior cerebellar peduncle pathway to the magnocellular red nucleus and rubral projections to premotor and motor nuclei generating the behavioral response. Anatomical data, neuronal unit recordings, electrical stimulation, lesions and methods of reversible inactivation all strongly support the hypothesis that the essential memory trace for the learning of these discrete conditioned responses is formed and stored in the cerebellar interpositus nucleus. Neuronal/synaptic plasticity is also established in the cerebellar cortex in this form of learning but the role of the cortex is less clear. We argue that the cortex plays a key role in normal acquisition and adaptive timing of the conditioned response, under certain circumstances, but it remains unclear exactly what features of conditioning are being encoded in the cerebellar cortex in this basic form of associative learning and memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Single unit recording of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex of the alert rhesus monkey was used to investigate responses to sensory stimulation. 32.4\% of the neurons had visual responses that had typical latencies of 100-200 ms, and 9.4\% responded to gustatory inputs. Most neurons were selective, in that they responded consistently to some stimuli such as foods or aversive objects, but not to others. In a number of cases the neurons responded selectively to particular foods or aversive stimuli. However, this high selectivity could not be explained by simple sensory features of the stimulus, since the responses of some neurons could be readily reversed if the meaning of the stimulus (i.e. whether it was food or aversive) was changed, even though its physical appearance remained identical. Further, some bimodal neurons received convergent visual and gustatory inputs, with matching selectivity for the same stimulus in both modalities, again suggesting that an explanation in terms of simple sensory features is inadequate. Neurons were also studied during the performance of tasks known to be disrupted by orbitofrontal lesions, including a go/no go visual discrimination task and its reversal. 8.6\% of neurons had differential responses to the two discriminative stimuli in the task, one of which indicated that reward was available and the other saline. Reversing the meaning of the two stimuli showed that whereas some differential units were closely linked to the sensory features of the stimuli, and some to their behavioural significance, others were conditional, in that they would only respond if a particular stimulus was present, and if it was the one being currently rewarded. Other neurons had activity related to the outcome of the animal's response, with some indicating that reinforcement had been received and others, that an error had been made and that a reversal was required. Thus, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex possess highly coded information about which stimuli are present, as well as information about the consequences of the animal's own responses. It is suggested that together they may constitute a neuronal mechanism for determining whether particular visual stimuli continue to be associated with reinforcement, as well as providing for the modification of the animal's behavioural responses to such stimuli when those responses are no longer appropriate.},

  Abstract                 = {We recorded neural activity in the ventral pallidum (VP) while rats learned a pavlovian reward association. Rats learned to distinguish a tone that predicted sucrose pellets (CS+) from a different tone that predicted nothing (CS-). Many VP units became responsive to CS+, but few units responded to CS-. When two CS+ were encountered sequentially, the earliest predictor of reward became most potent. Many VP units were also activated when the sucrose reward was received [unconditioned stimulus (UCS)]. These VP units for UCS remained responsive to sucrose reward after learning, even when sucrose was already predicted by CS+. Neural representation of reward learning and reward itself was characterized by population codes. The population of units that responded to CS+ increased with learning, whereas the population that responded to UCS did not change. A relative firing rate code also represented the identities of conditioned stimuli and UCS. Firing rate differences among stimuli were acquired early and remained stable during subsequent training, whereas population codes and behavioral conditioned responses continued to develop during subsequent training. Thus, the VP makes use of dynamic CS population and rate codes to encode pavlovian reward cues in reward learning and uses stable UCS population and firing codes to encode sucrose reward itself.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals learn not only about stimuli that predict reward but also about those that signal the omission of an expected reward. We used a conditioned inhibition paradigm derived from animal learning theory to train a discrimination between a visual stimulus that predicted reward (conditioned excitor) and a second stimulus that predicted the omission of reward (conditioned inhibitor). Performing the discrimination required attention to both the conditioned excitor and the inhibitor; however, dopamine neurons showed very different responses to the two classes of stimuli. Conditioned inhibitors elicited considerable depressions in 48 of 69 neurons (median of 35\% below baseline) and minor activations in 29 of 69 neurons (69\% above baseline), whereas reward-predicting excitors induced pure activations in all 69 neurons tested (242\% above baseline), thereby demonstrating that the neurons discriminated between conditioned stimuli predicting reward versus nonreward. The discriminative responses to stimuli with differential reward-predicting but common attentional functions indicate differential neural coding of reward prediction and attention. The neuronal responses appear to reflect reward prediction errors, thus suggesting an extension of the correspondence between learning theory and activity of single dopamine neurons to the prediction of nonreward.},

  Abstract                 = {It is important for animals to estimate the value of rewards as accurately as possible. Because the number of potential reward values is very large, it is necessary that the brain's limited resources be allocated so as to discriminate better among more likely reward outcomes at the expense of less likely outcomes. We found that midbrain dopamine neurons rapidly adapted to the information provided by reward-predicting stimuli. Responses shifted relative to the expected reward value, and the gain adjusted to the variance of reward value. In this way, dopamine neurons maintained their reward sensitivity over a large range of reward values.},

Our architecture assumes a general independence of attention and consciousness, but supposes strong interactions.

To test this theory, enumeration of static and moving items was investigated in 8-, 10-, 12-, and 20-year-old participants using a number discrimination task. As was predicted, random independent item motion did not substantially impede enumeration of 1-4 items regardless of age. However, even movement within a 1.14 degree square area slowed enumeration of 6-9 items, although on average the interference decreased with age from 788 msec for the 8-year-olds to 136 msec for the 20-year-olds. The relevance of this finding for theories of enumeration, multiple-object tracking, visual working memory, and object-based attention is discussed.},

"Counting," the process of enumeration when there are more than 4 items, is slow (250-350 ms/item), effortful, and error-prone. Why is there a difference in the way the small and large numbers of items are enumerated? A theory of enumeration is proposed that emerges from a general theory of vision, yet explains the numeric abilities of preverbal infants, children, and adults. We argue that subitizing exploits a limited-capacity parallel mechanism for item individuation, the FINST mechanism, associated with the multiple target tracking task (Pylyshyn, 1989; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988). Two kinds of evidence support the claim that subitizing relies on preattentive information, whereas counting requires spatial attention. First, whenever spatial attention is needed to compute a spatial relation (cf. Ullman, 1984) or to perform feature integration (cf. Treisman & Gelade, 1980), subitizing does not occur (Trick & Pylyshyn, 1993a). Second, the position of the attentional focus, as manipulated by cue validity, has a greater effect on counting than subitizing latencies (Trick & Pylyshyn, 1993b).},

Counting, the enumeration of 5 items or more, is slow (250-350 ms/item) and error-prone. Why are small numbers of items enumerated differently from large numbers of items? It is suggested that subitizing relies on a preattentive mechanism. Ss could subitize heterogeneously sized multicontour items but not concentric multicontour items, which require attentional processing because preattentive gestalt processes misgroup contours from different items to form units. Similarly, Ss could subitize target items among distractors but only if the targets and distractors differed by a feature, a property derived through preattentive analysis. Thus, subitizing must rely on a mechanism that can handle a few items at once, which operates before attention but after preattentive operations of feature detection and grouping.},

Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor in determining the neural code.},

However, little is known about the functional role of neurons in the BLA during the extinction of a reward-seeking behavior. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology procedures in freely moving rats to investigate whether and how the BLA encodes the extinction of responding for sucrose. We recorded 330 neurons from 15 rats during a within-session extinction procedure following training under a partial reinforcement schedule. Several distinct populations of neurons change their response profiles as the rat ceases to respond for the omitted reinforcer. One population of neurons (32 of 330; 10\%), which responded selectively to port entries in the presence, but not the absence, of sucrose during maintenance, subsequently developed a phasic response to port entries in the absence of sucrose during the extinction epoch only. The relative proportion of these "reinforcement-omission" neurons per rat was correlated with response intensity during extinction, as well as with the rate at which reward-seeking behavior was extinguished. A subpopulation of neurons responded with opposite phasic changes in activity to port entries in the presence of sucrose and to port entries during extinction, demonstrating that BLA neurons may contribute to the detection of value differences between expected and actual outcomes. Another population of neurons (47 of 330; 14\%) responded to the empty port only during extinction. Because BLA neural correlates reflect the omission of an expected reward, these neuronal populations may contribute to the expression of behavior during extinction.},

  Abstract                 = {How objects are represented and processed in the brain is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience. Previous studies have shown that knowledge of objects is represented in a feature-based distributed neural system primarily involving occipital and temporal cortical regions. Research with nonhuman primates suggest that these features are structured in a hierarchical system with posterior neurons in the inferior temporal cortex representing simple features and anterior neurons in the perirhinal cortex representing complex conjunctions of features (Bussey & Saksida, 2002; Murray & Bussey, 1999). On this account, the perirhinal cortex plays a crucial role in object identification by integrating information from different sensory systems into more complex polymodal feature conjunctions. We tested the implications of these claims for human object processing in an event-related fMRI study in which we presented colored pictures of common objects for 19 subjects to name at two levels of specificity - basic and domain. We reasoned that domain-level naming requires access to a coarser-grained representation of objects, thus involving only posterior regions of the inferior temporal cortex. In contrast, basic-level naming requires finer-grained discrimination to differentiate between similar objects, and thus should involve anterior temporal regions, including the perirhinal cortex. We found that object processing always activated the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, irrespective of the task, whereas the perirhinal cortex was only activated when the task required finer-grained discriminations. These results suggest that the same kind of hierarchical structure, which has been proposed for object processing in the monkey temporal cortex, functions in the human.},

In this report, the efferent projection of each subdivision of the Acb was examined using biotinylated dextran amine as an anterograde tracer. In rostral Acb, the dorsomedial shell mainly projected to the dorsomedial ventral pallidum (VP), lateral hypothalamus (LH) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), while the ventromedial shell projected to the ventromedial VP, lateral preoptic area, LH and ventral tegmental area (VTA). The dorsal core of rostral Acb projected to the caudate putamen, dorsolateral VP, globus pallidus (GP), LH, and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In the middle to caudal Acb, the dorsomedial shell mainly projected to the dorsomedial VP, LH and VTA, the ventromedial shell projected to the ventromedial VP, substantia innominata, VTA, SNc and retrorubral area, and the ventrolateral shell projected to the ventrolateral VP and SNc. Furthermore, the ventromedial shell projected to the parabrachial nucleus (PB). The dorsomedial core projected to the dorsal VP, LH, SNc and SNr, and the ventral and lateral core sent axons to the dorsolateral VP, GP and SNc. From the point of view of projection patterns, shell and core are distinct throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the Acb. The ventrolateral shell at the caudal Acb was clearly differentiated. A direct projection from the ventromedial shell of the Acb to PB was also recognised.},

  Abstract                 = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the rat supports cognitive flexibility, the ability to spontaneously adapt goal-directed behavior in response to radically changing situational demands. We have shown previously that transient inactivation of the rat medial PFC (mPFC) impairs initial reversal learning in a spatial 2-lever discrimination task. Given the importance of dopamine (DA) for PFC function, we studied DA (and noradrenaline [NA]) efflux in the mPFC during reversal learning. We observed a higher and more extended increase in DA efflux in rats performing the first reversal compared with controls performing the previously acquired discrimination. The results of an additional experiment suggest that such a difference between the reversal- and control-induced DA increases was absent during a third reversal. During the extinction session, DA efflux did not increase from basal levels. Increases in NA efflux were less than in DA and did not differ between control and any condition. We conclude that prefrontal DA activity is increased during execution of instrumental discrimination tasks and that this increase is amplified during the acquisition of a first, but not of later reversals. These data corroborate our previous findings and indicate that DA is critically involved in this form of cognitive flexibility.},

This response has been observed across species, including genetic linkages with human cognitive abilities, PFC activation states and DA synthesis. The cellular basis for the inverted U has long been sought, with in vitro intracellular recordings supporting a variety of potential mechanisms. The current study demonstrates that the D1R agonist inverted-U response can be observed in PFC neurons of behaving monkeys: low levels of D1R stimulation enhance spatial tuning by suppressing responses to nonpreferred directions, whereas high levels reduce delay-related firing for all directions, eroding tuning. These sculpting actions of D1R stimulation are mediated in monkeys and rats by cyclic AMP intracellular signaling. The evidence for an inverted U at the cellular level in behaving animals promises to bridge in vitro molecular analyses with human cognitive experience.},

We present here the ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect) neural simulator, which allows to easily define and simulate rate-coded and spiking networks, as well as combinations of both. The interface in Python has been designed to be close to the PyNN interface, while the definition of neuron and synapse models can be specified using an equation-oriented mathematical description similar to the Brian neural simulator. This information is used to generate C++ code that will efficiently perform the simulation on the chosen parallel hardware (multi-core system or graphical processing unit). Several numerical methods are available to transform ordinary differential equations into an efficient C++code. We compare the parallel performance of the simulator to existing solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Neural activity in dopaminergic areas such as the ventral tegmental area is influenced by timing processes, in particular by the temporal expectation of rewards during Pavlovian conditioning. Receipt of a reward at the expected time allows to compute reward-prediction errors which can drive learning in motor or cognitive structures. Reciprocally, dopamine plays an important role in the timing of external events. Several models of the dopaminergic system exist, but the substrate of temporal learning is rather unclear. In this article, we propose a neuro-computational model of the afferent network to the ventral tegmental area, including the lateral hypothalamus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the ventral basal ganglia (including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral pallidum), as well as the lateral habenula and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. Based on a plausible connectivity and realistic learning rules, this neuro-computational model reproduces several experimental observations, such as the progressive cancelation of dopaminergic bursts at reward delivery, the appearance of bursts at the onset of reward-predicting cues or the influence of reward magnitude on activity in the amygdala and ventral tegmental area. While associative learning occurs primarily in the amygdala, learning of the temporal relationship between the cue and the associated reward is implemented as a dopamine-modulated coincidence detection mechanism in the nucleus accumbens.},

  Abstract                 = {Visual working memory (WM) tasks involve a network of cortical areas such as inferotemporal, medial temporal and prefrontal cortices. We suggest here to investigate the role of the basal ganglia (BG) in the learning of delayed rewarded tasks through the selective gating of thalamocortical loops. We designed a computational model of the visual loop linking the perirhinal cortex, the BG and the thalamus, biased by sustained representations in prefrontal cortex. This model learns concurrently different delayed rewarded tasks that require to maintain a visual cue and to associate it to itself or to another visual object to obtain reward. The retrieval of visual information is achieved through thalamic stimulation of the perirhinal cortex. The input structure of the BG, the striatum, learns to represent visual information based on its association to reward, while the output structure, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, learns to link striatal representations to the disinhibition of the correct thalamocortical loop. In parallel, a dopaminergic cell learns to associate striatal representations to reward and modulates learning of connections within the BG. The model provides testable predictions about the behavior of several areas during such tasks, while providing a new functional organization of learning within the BG, putting emphasis on the learning of the striatonigral connections as well as the lateral connections within the substantia nigra pars reticulata. It suggests that the learning of visual WM tasks is achieved rapidly in the BG and used as a teacher for feedback connections from prefrontal cortex to posterior cortices.},

  Abstract                 = {The perirhinal cortex is involved not only in object recognition and novelty detection but also in multimodal integration, reward association, and visual working memory. We propose a computational model that focuses on the role of the perirhinal cortex in working memory, particularly with respect to sustained activities and memory retrieval. This model describes how different partial informations are integrated into assemblies of neurons that represent the identity of an object. Through dopaminergic modulation, the resulting clusters can retrieve the global information with recurrent interactions between neurons. Dopamine leads to sustained activities after stimulus disappearance that form the basis of the involvement of the perirhinal cortex in visual working memory processes. The information carried by a cluster can also be retrieved by a partial thalamic or prefrontal stimulation. Thus, we suggest that areas involved in planning and memory coordination encode a pointer to access the detailed information encoded in the associative cortex such as the perirhinal cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Transmission of signals within the brain is essential for cognitive function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable and accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range. Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.},

But this classic dorsal-ventral distinction might not offer the best view of striatal function. Anatomy and neurophysiology show that the two striatal areas have the same basic structure and that sharp boundaries are absent. Behaviorally, a distinction between dorsolateral and ventromedial seems most valid, in accordance with a mediolateral functional zonation imposed on the striatum by its excitatory cortical, thalamic and amygdaloid inputs. Therefore, this review presents a synthesis between the dorsal-ventral distinction and the more mediolateral-oriented functional striatal gradient.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensive previous research has implicated the hippocampus as an important structure for the acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning. Evidence from multiple species and various lesioning methods shows that the disruption of conditioned responding (CR) may be partially dependent on the relative lengths of the conditioned stimulus (CS) period and the trace interval. The present study systematically manipulated the length of the CS and the trace interval while matching the interstimulus intervals (ISI) in rats with or without ibotenic acid hippocampal lesions. The long-trace interval condition had a CS duration of 50 ms and a trace interval of 500 ms. The short-trace interval condition had a 500 ms CS and a 50 ms trace interval. We found that control animals in the long-trace interval condition learned at a slower rate than the control animals in the short-trace interval condition. Lesioned animals in both the trace conditions showed deficits in acquisition. Lesioned animals in the short-trace interval condition acquired conditioned responses at a rate almost identical to that of the control animals in the long-trace interval condition. CR onset latencies were impaired for lesioned animals. Peak latencies were not different, indicating no difference in the adaptiveness of the CRs. These results suggest that while the hippocampus is important for acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning, performance also depends on the parameters used for the task. In particular, the relative lengths of the CS period and the trace interval appear to be important.},

Novel and familiar pictures were presented simultaneously, one to each eye, using a paired viewing procedure. Differential neuronal activation was determined using immunohistochemistry for the protein products of c-fos as an imaging technique. The results establish that the regions of the rat brain associated with discriminating the novelty or familiarity of an individual item (such as a single object) differ from those responding to a spatial array of items (such as a scene). Perirhinal cortex and area TE of the temporal lobe are activated significantly more by pictures of novel than of familiar individual objects, but the hippocampus is not differentially activated. In contrast, pictures of novel arrangements of familiar items produce significantly greater activation than familiar arrangements of these items in postrhinal cortex and subfield CA1 of the hippocampus but significantly less activation in the dentate gyrus and subiculum; perirhinal cortex and area TE are not differentially activated. Thus, the hippocampus is importantly involved in processing information essential to recognition memory concerning the relative familiarity of arrangements of items, as needed for episodic memory of scenes, whereas the perirhinal cortex processes such information for individual items.},

To elucidate synaptic mechanisms of decision making, I investigated a biophysically realistic cortical network model for a visual discrimination experiment. In the model, slow recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition produce attractor dynamics that amplify the difference between conflicting inputs and generates a binary choice. The model is shown to account for salient characteristics of the observed decision-correlated neural activity, as well as the animal's psychometric function and reaction times. These results suggest that recurrent excitation mediated by NMDA receptors provides a candidate cellular mechanism for the slow time integration of sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choices in a decision-making neocortical network.},

  Abstract                 = {The thalamic mediodorsal nucleus (MD) has strong reciprocal connections with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), suggesting that the MD, like the DLPFC, participates in higher cognitive functions. To examine MD's participation in cognitive functions, we analyzed the characteristics of task-related activities sampled homogeneously from the MD while two monkeys performed a spatial working memory task using oculomotor responses. Of 141 task-related MD neurons, 26, 53, and 84\% exhibited cue-, delay-, and response-period activity, respectively. Most of cue- and response-period activities showed phasic excitation, and most of delay-period activity showed tonic sustained activation. Among neurons with response-period activity, 74\% exhibited presaccadic activity. Most cue-period, delay-period, and presaccadic activities were directional, whereas most postsaccadic activity was omni-directional. A significant contralateral bias in the best directions was present in cue-period and presaccadic activity. However, such bias was not present in delay-period activity, although most neurons had a best direction toward the contralateral visual field. We compared these characteristics with those observed in DLPFC neurons. Response-period activity was more frequently observed in the MD (84\%) than in the DLPFC (56\%). The directional selectivity and bias of task-related activities and the ratios of pre- and postsaccadic activities were different between MD and DLPFC. These results indicate that the MD participates in higher cognitive functions such as spatial working memory. However, the manner in which these two structures participate in these processes differs, in that the MD participates more in motor control aspects compared with the DLPFC.},

We used two oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) tasks. In the ordinary ODR task, monkeys were required to make a memory-guided saccade to the location where a visual cue had been presented 3 s previously, whereas in the rotatory ODR task, they were required to make a memory-guided saccade 90 degrees clockwise from the cue direction. By comparing the best directions of the same task-related activity between the two tasks, we could determine whether this activity represented the cue location or the saccade direction. All cue-period activity represented the cue location. In contrast, 56\% of delay-period activity represented the cue location and 41\% represented the saccade direction. Almost all response-period activity represented the saccade direction. These results indicate that task-related MD activity represents either visual or motor information, suggesting that the MD participates in sensory-to-motor information processing. However, a greater proportion of delay- and response-period activities represented the saccade direction in the MD than in the DLPFC, indicating that more MD neurons participate in prospective information processing than DLPFC neurons. These results suggest that although functional interactions between the MD and DLPFC are crucial to cognitive functions such as working memory, there is a difference in how the MD and DLPFC participate in these functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Inferior temporal cortex is perhaps the highest visual processing area and much anatomical work has focused on its connections with other visual areas in temporal and occipital cortex. Here we report connections of inferior temporal cortex with regions in the frontal and parietal lobes. Inferior temporal areas TEO and TE were injected with WGA-HRP and 3H-AA, respectively, or vice versa, in 1-week-old infant and 3-4-year-old adult monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The results indicated that whereas TEO has more extensive connections with parietal areas, TE has more extensive connections with prefrontal areas. Thus, in the intraparietal sulcus, area TEO is connected with areas LIPd, LIPv, and V3A, and with the as yet undefined region between LIPv and V3A, whereas the connections of TE are predominantly with LIPd, and to a lesser extent with LIPv. In the prefrontal cortex, area TE is connected with areas 8 and 45 in the inferior limb of the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus, with area 12 on the inferior prefrontal convexity, and with areas 11 and 13 on the orbital surface. By contrast, the connections of area TEO are limited to areas 8, 45, and 12. Furthermore, within prefrontal cortex, the projections from areas TEO and TE terminate in different layers in areas 8 and 45, such that those from TEO terminate in all layers, whereas those from TEO terminate in layers I and V/VI only. In contrast to the connections of areas TEO and TE with various medial temporal-lobe and subcortical structures, which are immature in infant monkeys (Webster et al., 1991, 1993b), the connections with parietal and prefrontal areas appear adult-like as early as 1 week of age.},

  Abstract                 = {In vivo intracellular recordings of spontaneous activity of neostriatal spiny cells revealed two-state behavior, i.e., characteristic shifts of membrane potential between two preferred levels. The more polarized level, called the Down state, varied among neurons from -61 to -94 mV. The more depolarized level, called the Up state, varied among neurons form -71 to -40 mV. For any one neuron, the membrane potential in the Up and Down states was constant over the period of observation (from 15 min to 4 hr), and the cells spent little time in transition between states. The level of membrane potential noise was higher in the Up state than in the Down state. Spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations were not abolished by experimental alteration of the membrane potential, but the time spent in each state was altered when intracellular current was used to vary the baseline membrane potential. Neither the sodium nor the calcium action potential that could be evoked by depolarization of spiny neurons was required for the occurrence of spontaneous shifts of membrane potential. Blockade of these action potentials using intracellular injection of QX314 and D890, respectively, altered neither the incidence of the membrane potential shifts nor the preferred membrane potential in either state. In contrast, antagonism of voltage-dependent potassium channels with intracellular cesium altered membrane potential shifts. In the presence of QX314 and D890, intracellular injection of cesium caused little or no change in the Down state and a large depolarizing shift in the Up state (to about -20 mV). Under these circumstances, the neuron responded to current in a nearly linear manner, and membrane conductance was found to be increased in the Up state, attributable to a membrane conductance with the same reversal potential as that of the synaptic potential evoked by cortical stimulation. These results indicate that the event underlying the Up state is a maintained barrage of synaptic excitation, but that the membrane potential achieved during the Up state in neostriatal spiny neurons is determined by dendritic potassium channels that clamp the membrane potential at a level determined by their voltage sensitivity. Neostriatal spiny neurons ordinarily receive enormously powerful excitation, which would drive the cells to saturation, and probably destroy them, if it were not for these potassium currents.},

Our simulation results indicate that most measures of efficient coding correlate with the similarity of model receptive field data to V1 data, that is, optimizing the estimate of efficient coding increases the similarity of the model data to experimental data. However, the degree of the correlation varies with the different estimates of efficient coding, and in particular, the variance in the firing pattern of each cell does not predict a similarity of model and experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {The expectancy of a rewarding outcome following actions and cues is coded by a network of brain structures including the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus far, predicted reward was considered to be coded by time-averaged spike rates of neurons. However, besides firing rate, the precise timing of action potentials in relation to ongoing oscillations in local field potentials is thought to be of importance for effective communication between brain areas. We performed multineuron and field potential recordings in orbitofrontal cortex of rats performing olfactory discrimination learning to study the temporal structure of coding predictive of outcome. After associative learning, field potentials were marked by theta oscillations, both in advance and during delivery of reward. Orbitofrontal neurons, especially those coding information about upcoming reward with their firing rate, phase locked to these oscillations in anticipation of reward. When established associations were reversed, phase locking collapsed in the anticipatory task phase, but returned when reward became predictable again after relearning. Behaviorally, the outcome anticipation phase was marked by licking responses, but the frequency of lick responses was dissociated from the strength of theta-band phase locking. The strength of theta-band phase locking by orbitofrontal neurons robustly follows the dynamics of associative learning as measured by behavior and correlates with the rat's current outcome expectancy. Theta-band phase locking may facilitate communication of outcome-related information between reward-related brain areas and offers a novel mechanism for coding value signals during reinforcement learning.},

  Abstract                 = {This review presents the hypothesis that the best way to consider the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is by analogy with the substantia nigra. The substantia nigra contains two main compartments: the pars compacta and the pars reticulata. The former contains dopamine neurons that project widely within the basal ganglia while the latter is in receipt of corticostriatal output. Similarly, the PPTg contains the Ch5 acetylcholine containing neurons that project to the thalamus and corticostriatal systems (notably the pars compacta of substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus) while the non-cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine are in receipt of corticostriatal output. Assessment of the location, composition and connections of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is made to support the hypothesis that it has structural similarities with substantia nigra. Assessment of the motor, sensory and cognitive functions of the pedunculopontine is also made, suggesting functional similarities exist also. Having a clear model of pedunculopontine structure and function is a matter of some importance. It is clearly involved in Parkinson's disease and could potentially be a target for therapeutic intervention. If this is to be realized it will be best to have as clear an understanding as possible of pedunculopontine structure and function in order to maximize positive benefits.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is involved in regulating motor function, and inactivation of this structure relieves the motor symptoms in Parkinsonian patients, recent data indicate that corticosubthalamic connections are involved in both the regulation of attention and the ability to withhold from responding. Considerable evidence suggests that the neural circuitry underlying such behavioural disinhibition or impulsive action can be at least partially dissociated from that implicated in impulsive decision-making and it has been suggested that the tendency to choose impulsively is related to the ability to form and use Pavlovian associations. To explore these hypotheses further, STN-lesioned rats were tested on the delay-discounting model of impulsive choice, where impulsivity is defined as the selection of a small immediate over a larger delayed reward, as well as in a rodent autoshaping paradigm. In contrast to previous reports of increased impulsive action, STN lesions decreased impulsive choice but dramatically impaired the acquisition of the autoshaping response. When the STN was lesioned after the establishment of autoshaping behaviour, lesioned subjects were more sensitive to the omission of reward, indicative of a reduction in the use of Pavlovian associations to control autoshaping performance. These results emphasize the importance of the STN in permitting conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus associations to regulate goal-seeking, a function which may relate to the alterations in impulsive choice observed in the delay-discounting task. These data bear a striking similarity to those observed after lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex and are suggestive of an important role for corticosubthalamic connections in complex cognitive behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {Object recognition is consistently impaired in human amnesia and animal models thereof. Results from subjects with permanent brain damage have revealed the importance of the perirhinal cortex to object recognition memory. Here, we report evidence from rats for interdependent but distinct stages in object recognition memory (encoding, retrieval, and consolidation), which require glutamate receptor activity within perirhinal cortex. Transient blockade of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission within perirhinal cortex disrupted encoding for short- and long-term memory as well as retrieval and consolidation. In contrast, transient NMDA receptor blockade during encoding affected only long-term object recognition memory; NMDA receptor activity was also necessary for consolidation but not retrieval. These results further demonstrate the importance of perirhinal cortex for object recognition memory and suggest that, as in the hippocampus, AMPA and NMDA receptors mediate synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, respectively, in several stages of memory processing.},

Dopamine is released by a unique set of amacrine cells and activates D1 and D2 dopamine receptors distributed throughout the retina. Multiple dopamine-dependent physiological mechanisms result in an increased signal flow through cone circuits and a diminution of signal flow through rod circuits. Dopamine also has multiple trophic roles in retinal function related to circadian rhythmicity, cell survival and eye growth. In a reciprocal way, the health of the dopaminergic neurons depends on their receiving light-driven synaptic inputs. Dopamine neurons appear early in development, become functional in advance of the animal's onset of vision and begin to die in aging animals. Some diseases affecting photoreceptor function also diminish day/night differences in dopamine release and turnover. A reduction in retinal dopamine, as occurs in Parkinsonian patients, results in reduced visual contrast sensitivity.},

Although several studies have assessed cognitive functions before surgery and after long-term STN stimulation, only a few have assessed patients while stimulation is on and off to more specifically address the short-term cognitive effects of STN deep brain stimulation.To examine the short-term effects of STN stimulation on several tests sensitive to executive function and the long-term effects of STN stimulation on a global cognitive scale.Twenty-three patients with Parkinson disease were tested 6 to 12 months after surgery with STN stimulation switched on and off in a random order while taking their regular medication. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was also rated in the on and off stimulation condition. The neuropsychological battery included digit span, verbal fluency, Stroop color test, and random number generation in a single- and dual-task condition.Short-term stimulation improved the results on the Random Number Generation Task, requiring suppression of habitual responses, but induced more errors in the interference task of the Stroop color test. Digit span, verbal fluency, and dual-task performance results did not change. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.47, P =.02) between improved performance on the Random Number Generation Task and impaired response inhibition in the Stroop interference condition. A preoperative to postoperative comparison showed no changes in global cognitive function with long-term STN deep brain stimulation.Short-term STN stimulation improves cognitive flexibility (giving up habitual responses) but impairs response inhibition. Long-term STN stimulation does not change global cognitive function.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a computational model of the principal cell in the nucleus accumbens (NAcb), the medium spiny projection (MSP) neuron. The model neuron, constructed in NEURON, includes all of the known ionic currents in these cells and receives synaptic input from simulated spike trains via NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA receptors. After tuning the model by adjusting maximal current conductances in each compartment, the model cell closely matched whole-cell recordings from an adult rat NAcb slice preparation. Synaptic inputs in the range of 1000-1300 Hz are required to maintain an "up" state in the model. Cell firing in the model required concurrent depolarization of several dendritic branches, which responded independently to afferent input. Depolarization from action potentials traveled to the tips of the dendritic branches and increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. As NMDA/AMPA current ratios were increased, the membrane showed an increase in hysteresis of "up" and "down" state dwell times, but intrinsic bistability was not observed. The number of oscillatory inputs required to entrain the model cell was determined to be approximately 20\% of the "up" state inputs. Altering the NMDA/AMPA ratio had a profound effect on processing of afferent input, including the ability to entrain to oscillations in afferent input in the theta range (4-12 Hz). These results suggest that afferent information integration by the NAcb MSP cell may be compromised by pathology in which the NMDA current is altered or modulated, as has been proposed in both schizophrenia and addiction.},

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) have therefore become an important focus of addiction research. This article reviews: (1) basic mechanisms underlying LTP and LTD, (2) the properties of LTP and LTD in ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex, (3) studies demonstrating that psychomotor stimulants influence LTP or LTD in these brain regions. In addition, we discuss our recent work on cellular mechanisms by which dopamine may influence LTP and LTD. Based on evidence that AMPA receptors are inserted into synapses during LTP and removed during LTD, we investigated the effects of D1 receptor stimulation on AMPA receptor trafficking using primary cultures prepared from nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that activation of the D1 receptor-protein kinase A signaling pathway leads to externalization of AMPA receptors and promotes LTP. This provides a mechanism to explain facilitation of reward-related learning by dopamine. When this mechanism is activated in an unregulated manner by psychostimulants, maladaptive forms of neuroplasticity may occur that contribute to the transition from casual to compulsive drug use.},

  Abstract                 = {In many theories of cognition, researchers propose that working memory and perception operate interactively. For example, in previous studies researchers have suggested that sensory inputs matching the contents of working memory will have an automatic advantage in the competition for processing resources. The authors tested this hypothesis by requiring observers to perform a visual search task while concurrently maintaining object representations in visual working memory. The hypothesis that working memory activation produces a simple but uncontrollable bias signal leads to the prediction that items matching the contents of working memory will automatically capture attention. However, no evidence for automatic attentional capture was obtained; instead, the participants avoided attending to these items. Thus, the contents of working memory can be used in a flexible manner for facilitation or inhibition of processing.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous research suggests that target templates are stored visual working memory and used to guide attention during visual search. However, observers can search efficiently even if working memory is filled to capacity by a concurrent task. The idea that target templates are stored in working memory receives support primarily from studies of nonhuman primates in which the target varies from trial to trial, and it is possible that working memory templates are not necessary when target identity remains constant, as in most studies of visual search in humans. To test this hypothesis, we asked subjects to perform a visual search task during the delay interval of a visual working memory task. The 2 tasks were found to interfere with each other when the search targets changed from trial to trial, but not when target identity remained constant. Thus, a search template is stored in visual working memory only when the target varies from trial to trial. These findings suggest that the network of brain areas involved in shifting attention during visual search tasks may be able to operate essentially independently of the anatomical areas that perform visual working memory maintenance of objects, but only if the identity of the visual search target is stable across time.},

Here, we investigated the involvement of the hippocampus in DEC with a soft tone as the conditioned stimulus (CS) by using electrolytic lesions or muscimol inactivation of guinea pig dorsal hippocampus. Interestingly, when a soft tone was used as a CS, electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus significantly retarded acquisition of the conditioned response (CR), and muscimol infusions into hippocampus distinctly inhibited the acquisition and expression of CR, but had no significant effect on consolidation of well-learned CR. In contrast, both electrolytic lesions and muscimol inactivation of hippocampus produced no significant deficits in the CR when a loud tone was used as the CS. These results demonstrate that the hippocampus is essential for the DEC when the delay task was rendered more difficult.},

DA or the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393, but not the D2 agonist quinpirole, reduced the first spike latency and lowered the firing threshold of the PFC neurons in response to depolarizing current pulses. This was accomplished by enhancing the duration of a tetradotoxinsensitive, slowly inactivating Na+ current and attenuating a slowly inactivating, outwardly rectifying, dendrotoxin-sensitive K+ current. Furthermore, D1 receptor stimulation attenuated high-threshold Ca2+ spike(s) (HTS) evoked primarily from the apical dendrites of these PFC neurons. Taken together, these data suggest that D1 receptor stimulation on layers V-VI pyramidal PFC neurons: (1) restricts the effects of inputs to the apical dendrites of these neurons by attenuating the dendritic HTS-mediated amplification of such inputs; and (2) potentiates the influence of local inputs from neighboring deep layers V-VI neurons by enhancing the slowly inactivating Na+ current and attenuating the slowly inactivating K+ current. By influencing the input/output characteristics of PFC-->NAc neurons, DA may play an important role in the processes through which PFC signals are translated into action.},

  Abstract                 = {Habits are controlled by antecedent stimuli rather than by goal expectancy. Interval schedules of feedback have been shown to generate habits, as revealed by the insensitivity of behaviour acquired under this schedule to outcome devaluation treatments. Two experiments were conducted to assess the role of the dorsolateral striatum in habit learning. In Experiment 1, sham operated controls and rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions were trained to press a lever for sucrose under interval schedules. After training, the sucrose was devalued by inducing taste aversion to it using lithium chloride, whereas saline injections were given to the controls. Only rats given the devaluation treatment reduced their consumption of sucrose and this reduction was similar in both the sham and the lesioned groups. All rats were then returned to the instrumental chamber for an extinction test, in which the lever was extended but no sucrose was delivered. In contrast to sham operated controls, rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions refrained from pressing the lever if the outcome was devalued. To assess the specificity of the role of dorsolateral striatum in this effect a second experiment was conducted in which a group with lesions of dorsomedial striatum was added. In relation now to both the sham and the dorsomedial lesioned groups, only rats with lesions of dorsolateral striatum significantly reduced responding after outcome devaluation. In conclusion, this study provides direct evidence that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for habit formation. Furthermore, it suggests that, when the habit system is disrupted, control over instrumental performance reverts to the system controlling the performance of goal-directed instrumental actions.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of studies have shown that the perirhinal (PRh) cortex, which is part of the medial temporal lobe memory system, plays an important role in declarative long-term memory. The PRh cortex contains neurons that represent visual long-term memory. The aim of the present study is to characterize the anatomical organization of forward projections that mediate information flow from visual area TE to memory neurons in the PRh cortex. In monkeys performing a visual pair-association memory task, we conducted an extensive mapping of neuronal responses in the anteroventral part of area TE (TEav) and area 36 (A36) of the PRh cortex. Then, three retrograde tracers were separately injected into A36 and the distribution of retrograde labels in TEav was analyzed. We focused on the degree of divergent projections from TEav to memory neurons in A36, because the highly divergent nature of these forward fiber projections has been implicated in memory function. We found that the degree of divergent projection to memory neurons in A36 was smaller from the TEav neurons selective to learned pictures than from the nonselective TEav neurons. This result demonstrates that the anatomical difference (the divergence) correlates with the physiological difference (selectivity of TEav neurons to the learned pictures). Because the physiological difference is attributed to whether the projections are involved in information transmission required for memory neurons in A36, it can be speculated that the reduced divergent projection resulted from acquisition of visual long-term memory, possibly through retraction of the projecting axon collaterals.},

  Abstract                 = {The striatopallidal projection originating in the nucleus accumbens was investigated by using anterograde transport of PHA-L in combination with peptide immunohistochemistry in order to localize the injection sites and transported lectin with respect to neurochemically defined subterritories in the nucleus accumbens and subcommissural ventral pallidum. The results reported here supplement our previous observations, which indicated that the subcommissural ventral pallidum of the rat comprises two immunohistochemically defined subterritories (Zahm and Heimer, '88: J. Comp. Neurol., 272:516-535) which give rise to dichotomous downstream projection systems (Zahm, '89: Neuroscience, 30:33-50). The present data indicate that the neurotensin immunoreactivity-rich ventromedial district of ventral pallidum receives its accumbal input almost exclusively from the shell district of the nucleus accumbens. The accumbal core, alternatively, projects to the dorsolateral ventral pallidal subterritory that lacks appreciable neurotensin immunoreactivity and in many other respects more resembles the adjoining striatopallidal components of the caudate-putamen. In addition to direct topographic relationships in the frontal plane among the accumbal injection sites and ventral pallidal terminations, it was observed that more caudally placed core injections resulted in patches of striatopallidal terminations that were more caudally located in ventral pallidum. Shell injections, in contrast, produced columns of terminations that extended continuously from the rostralmost level that they appeared to the caudal end of ventromedial ventral pallidum. The accumbal shell, its exclusive projection to the ventromedial subterritory in the subcommissural ventral pallidum, and the previously reported, almost exclusive projection of that pallidal subdistrict to the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area are discussed in terms of a number of other neurochemical and hodological features that serve to distinguish them sufficiently to suggest that they represent a uniquely specialized part of the basal ganglia.},

  Abstract                 = {Although previous research has emphasized the beneficial effects of dopamine (DA) on functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), recent studies of animals exposed to mild stress indicate that excessive DA receptor stimulation may be detrimental to the spatial working memory functions of the PFC (Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic, 1990; Murphy et al., 1994, 1996a,b, 1997). In particular, these studies have suggested that supranormal stimulation of D1 receptors may contribute to the detrimental actions of DA in the PFC (Murphy et al., 1994, 1996a). The current study directly tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of infusing a full D1 receptor agonist, SKF 81297, into the PFC of rats performing a spatial working memory task, delayed alternation. SKF 81297 produced a dose-related impairment in delayed-alternation performance. The impairment was reversed by pretreatment with a D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, consistent with drug actions at D1 receptors. SCH 23390 by itself had no effect on performance, although slightly higher doses impaired performance (Murphy et al., 1994, 1996a). There was a significant relationship between infusion location and drug efficacy; animals with cannulae anterior to the PFC were not impaired by SKF 81297 infusions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that supranormal D1 receptor stimulation in the PFC is sufficient to impair PFC working memory function. These cognitive data are consistent with recent electrophysiological studies of D1 receptor mechanisms affecting the PFC (Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Yang and Seamans, 1996). Increased D1 receptor stimulation during stress may serve to take the PFC "off-line" to allow posterior cortical and subcortical structures to regulate behavior, but may contribute to the vulnerability of the PFC in many neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {NEST is a simulator for large-scale networks of spiking point neuron models (Gewaltig and Diesmann, 2007). Originally, simulations were controlled via the Simulation Language Interpreter (SLI), a built-in scripting facility implementing a language derived from PostScript (Adobe Systems, Inc., 1999). The introduction of PyNEST (Eppler et al., 2008), the Python interface for NEST, enabled users to control simulations using Python. As the majority of NEST users found PyNEST easier to use and to combine with other applications, it immediately displaced SLI as the default NEST interface. However, developing and maintaining PyNEST has become increasingly difficult over time. This is partly because adding new features requires writing low-level C++ code intermixed with calls to the Python/C API, which is unrewarding. Moreover, the Python/C API evolves with each new version of Python, which results in a proliferation of version-dependent code branches. In this contribution we present the re-implementation of PyNEST in the Cython language, a superset of Python that additionally supports the declaration of C/C++ types for variables and class attributes, and provides a convenient foreign function interface (FFI) for invoking C/C++ routines (Behnel et al., 2011). Code generation via Cython allows the production of smaller and more maintainable bindings, including increased compatibility with all supported Python releases without additional burden for NEST developers. Furthermore, this novel approach opens up the possibility to support alternative implementations of the Python language at no cost given a functional Cython back-end for the corresponding implementation, and also enables cross-compilation of Python bindings for embedded systems and supercomputers alike.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand how the central nervous system performs computations using recurrent neuronal circuitry, simulations have become an indispensable tool for theoretical neuroscience. To study neuronal circuits and their ability to self-organize, increasing attention has been directed toward synaptic plasticity. In particular spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) creates specific demands for simulations of spiking neural networks. On the one hand a high temporal resolution is required to capture the millisecond timescale of typical STDP windows. On the other hand network simulations have to evolve over hours up to days, to capture the timescale of long-term plasticity. To do this efficiently, fast simulation speed is the crucial ingredient rather than large neuron numbers. Using different medium-sized network models consisting of several thousands of neurons and off-the-shelf hardware, we compare the simulation speed of the simulators: Brian, NEST and Neuron as well as our own simulator Auryn. Our results show that real-time simulations of different plastic network models are possible in parallel simulations in which numerical precision is not a primary concern. Even so, the speed-up margin of parallelism is limited and boosting simulation speeds beyond one tenth of real-time is difficult. By profiling simulation code we show that the run times of typical plastic network simulations encounter a hard boundary. This limit is partly due to latencies in the inter-process communications and thus cannot be overcome by increased parallelism. Overall, these results show that to study plasticity in medium-sized spiking neural networks, adequate simulation tools are readily available which run efficiently on small clusters. However, to run simulations substantially faster than real-time, special hardware is a prerequisite.},

Corticostriatal neurons were located in the medial agranular or anterior cingulate cortex of rats. All axons were of the extended type and formed synaptic contacts in both the striosomal and matrix compartments as determined by counterstaining for the mu-opiate receptor. Six axonal arborizations were from collaterals of brain stem-projecting cells and the other 10 from bilaterally projecting cells with no brain stem projections. The distribution of synaptic boutons along the axons were convolved with the average dendritic tree volume of spiny projection neurons to obtain an axonal innervation volume and innervation density map for each axon. Innervation volumes varied widely, with single axons occupying between 0.4 and 14.2\% of the striatum (average = 4\%). The total number of boutons formed by individual axons ranged from 25 to 2,900 (average = 879). Within the innervation volume, the density of innervation was extremely sparse but inhomogeneous. The pattern of innervation resembled matrisomes, as defined by bulk labeling and functional mapping experiments, superimposed on a low background innervation. Using this sample as representative of all corticostriatal axons, the total number of corticostriatal neurons was estimated to be 17 million, about 10 times the number of striatal projection neurons.},

[(1999)Perception & Psychophysics, 61, 403-423] subjects had to report the identity of multiple letters that were briefly presented at different locations, while two of these locations (targets) were relevant for a concurrent shape comparison task. In addition to the design used by Bichot et al. stimulus onset asynchrony between shape onset and letters was systematically varied. In general, the performance of subjects was superior at target locations. Furthermore, for short stimulus onset asynchronies, performance was simultaneously increasing at both target locations. For longer stimulus onset asynchronies, however, performance deteriorated at one of the target locations while increasing at the other target location. It was hypothesized that this dynamic deployment of attention might be caused by competitive processes in saccade-related structures such as the frontal eye field. Here we simulated the task of Dubois et al. using a systems-level model of attention. Our results are consistent with recent findings in the frontal eye field obtained during covert visual search, and they support the view of a transient deployment of spatial attention to multiple stimuli in the early epoch of target selection.},

This lesion, which includes the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and adjacent cortex, including the parahippocampal gyrus (the H+A+ lesion), appears to constitute an animal model of human medial temporal lobe amnesia. Reexamination of histological material from previously studied monkeys with H+A+ lesions indicated that the perirhinal cortex had also sustained significant damage. Furthermore, recent neuroanatomical studies show that the perirhinal cortex and the closely associated parahippocampal cortex provide the major source of cortical input to the hippocampal formation. Based on these 2 findings, we evaluated the severity of memory impairment in a group of monkeys that received bilateral lesions limited to the perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (the PRPH lesion). The performance of the PRPH group was compared with that of monkeys with H+A+ lesions, who had been studied previously, and with a group of normal monkeys. Monkeys with PRPH lesions were severely impaired on 3 amnesia-sensitive tasks: delayed nonmatching to sample, object retention, and 8-pair concurrent discrimination. On pattern discrimination, a task analogous to ones that amnesic patients perform well, monkeys in the PRPH group performed normally. Overall, monkeys with PRPH lesions were as impaired or more impaired than the comparison group of monkeys with H+A+ lesions. These and other recent findings (Zola-Morgan et al., 1989b) suggest that the severe memory impairment in monkeys and humans associated with bilateral medial temporal lesions results from damage to the hippocampal formation and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, not from conjoint hippocampus-amygdala damage.},
